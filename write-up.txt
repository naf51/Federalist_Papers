About / Research Question:

Do you ever wonder if politicians say what they truly believe in? We generally see politicians today as persuasive orators with selfish motives 
to make their audience believe something that is not truthful or real seem real and attainable. Our research question for this project is the 
following: The How does the image and appeal of political arguments in persuasive literature like the Federalist Papers compare to the political
ideologies of their authors?

Why We Chose The Federalist Papers:

Of all the politicians with a vast collective of speeches and writing, we chose to analyze the Federalist Papers. Why? We chose them because of
their purpose: to convince the states (mainly the State of New York) to ratify the newly written Constitution. It is a corpus that was intended
to persuade, inform, and say to the world that the newly established democracy was thoughtfully created and supported by the people who developed
it. More importantly, it was addressed "To the People of the State of New York:". Meaning, it was intended for the people, or was it? The majority
of the general public during this time grew tired of Britian's tyrranical madness and desired a life that granted more independence, liberties,
and unconstrained social/economic mobility. So, under this prevalent ideology, the Federalist Papers and their author, are a prime resource
to see if Hamilton's rhetoric actually aligned with the Federalist Party's values, or if it appealed to the masses. 

Why We Chose Hamilton:

Out of the three authors of the Federalist Papers, we chose Alexander Hamilton. Why? We have three important reasons. First, he was the main
contributor to the Papers and their publication. Out of all 85 Federalist Papers, he wrote 51, with James Madison writing 29, and John Jay 
writing 5. Second, he was known to be the father and creator of the Federalist Party, the first established political party in US history. 
So, his political ideology would be the closest to that party's beliefs, which would be useful when considering our research question. Third,
much of the letters written by him were very dense and were centered around important features of the newly created government. Some of these
features were: The Judiciary, Executive, and Legislative branches, the Bill of Rights, the Military, and the powers of Taxation.

Our Methods:

We chose approximately half of the papers chosen by Hamilton and chose them on the basis of content. Many of his papers were additions to a certain
topic. So, to have the ability to use all topics, some were taken out for the sake of time. We identified thirteen element tags that specified the
topic of content. These were features of government like the judiciary, executive, military, taxation, etc. Within those elements were four 
attributes: "elitist", "populist", "both", and "neither". These indicate the tone and type of statement/belief Hamilton possesses within a
certain element. This combination is a way to track and analyze his views and opinions on certain aspects of government. We created our markup in
XML, validated the papers via a RelaxNG schema, and used MALLET for topic-modeling, which would provide a visual of the content within the papers
that was vital towards the comparison 

Our Sources:

We used a variety of sources for the research and analysis of this project. We found an XML document of all 85 Federalist Papers from Github.
Specifically, the federalist-bookworm: https://github.com/bmschmidt/federalist-bookworm. We narrowed our markup documents by utilizing the
Library of Congress online resource/database of the Federalist Papers, which show the author and provide a small summary of each paper. From
there, we marked up the 24 papers we chose with the elements and attributes created, along with changing the metadata and the root element. Next, 
we created an RelaxNG Schema and conducted a batch validation across all 24 papers.
