                <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Overall, the Federalist Papers are an interesting collection of documents because of
                its density but also its reach to various topics of government and politics. These
                documents could be analyzed in numerous ways. For instance, network analysis would
                be a very useful tool to see connections to specific themes and topics. However, for
                this project, we decided to use MALLET and topic-modeling as our primary method to
                analyse these documents in order to help answer our research question.</p>

            <h2>Our Methods:</h2>
            <p>We chose approximately half of the papers chosen by Hamilton and chose them on the
                basis of content. Many of his papers were additions to a certain topic. So, to have
                the ability to use all topics, some were taken out for the sake of time. We
                identified thirteen element tags that specified the topic of content. These were
                features of government like the judiciary, executive, military, taxation, etc.
                Within those elements were four attributes: "elitist", "populist", "both", and
                "neither". These indicate the tone and type of statement/belief Hamilton possesses
                within a certain element. This combination is a way to track and analyze his views
                and opinions on certain aspects of government. We created our markup in XML,
                validated the papers via a RelaxNG schema, and used MALLET for topic-modeling, which
                would provide a visual of the content within the papers that was vital towards the
                comparison.</p>

            <h2>Our Sources:</h2>
            <p>We used a variety of sources for the research and analysis of this project. We found
                an XML document of all 85 Federalist Papers from Github. Specifically, the
                federalist-bookworm: https://github.com/bmschmidt/federalist-bookworm. We narrowed
                our markup documents by utilizing the Library of Congress online resource/database
                of the Federalist Papers, which show the author and provide a small summary of each
                paper. From there, we marked up the 24 papers we chose with the elements and
                attributes created, along with changing the metadata and the root element. Next, we
                created an RelaxNG Schema and conducted a batch validation across all 24 papers.</p>
            <p>We used governmental resources such as the Library of Congress's website that
                displays the corpus of documents to indicate which of the three founding father's
                wrote which paper. Because they all wrote under the pen name "Publius", latin
                meaning "the people", it would have been virtually impossible to know who wrote each
                paper. This was vital for our selection of documents for our analysis.</p>
