      <span class="address" about="">To the People of the State of New York:</span>
      <span class="federalism" about="elitist">To THE powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal
         government,</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">in respect to the creation and direction of the national
         forces, I have met with but one specific objection, which, if I understand it
         right, is this, that proper provision has not been made against the existence of
         standing armies in time of peace;</span> an objection which, I shall now
      endeavor to show, rests on weak and unsubstantial foundations.<br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="historicalComparison" about="elitist">It has indeed been brought forward in the most
         vague and general form, supported only by bold assertions, without the
         appearance of argument; without even the sanction of theoretical opinions; in
         contradiction to the practice of other free nations, and to the general sense of
         America, as expressed in most of the existing
         constitutions.</span>
      <span class="legislature" about="elitist">The proprietory of this remark will appear, the moment
         it is recollected that the objection under consideration turns upon a supposed
         necessity of restraining the LEGISLATIVE authority of the nation</span>,
      <span class="military" about="elitist">in the article of military establishments; a principle
         unheard of, except in one or two of our State constitutions, and rejected in all
         the rest.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      A stranger to our politics, who was to read our newspapers at the present juncture,
      without having previously inspected the plan reported by the convention, would be
      naturally led to one of two conclusions: <span class="military" about="elitist">either that it
         contained a positive injunction, that standing armies should be kept up in time
         of peace;</span>
      <span class="executive" about="elitist">or that it vested in the EXECUTIVE the whole power of
         levying troops, without subjecting his discretion, in any shape, to the control
         of the legislature.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="legislature" about="elitist">If he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself, he would
         be surprised to discover, that neither the one nor the other was the case; that
         the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the LEGISLATURE, not in the
         EXECUTIVE; that this legislature was to be a popular body, consisting of the
         representatives of the people periodically elected;</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">and that instead of the provision he had supposed in favor
         of standing armies, there was to be found, in respect to this object, an
         important qualification even of the legislative discretion, in that clause which
         forbids the appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer
         period than two years a precaution which, upon a nearer view of it, will appear
         to be a great and real security against the keeping up of troops without evident
         necessity.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      Disappointed in his first surmise, the person I have supposed would be apt to pursue
      his conjectures a little further. <span class="significantPhrase" about="elitist">He would
         naturally say to himself, it is impossible that all this vehement and pathetic
         declamation can be without some colorable pretext.</span>
      <span class="liberty" about="elitist">It must needs be that this people, so jealous of their
         liberties, have, in all the preceding models of the constitutions which they
         have established, inserted the most precise and rigid precautions on this point,
         the omission of which, in the new plan, has given birth to all this apprehension
         and clamor.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">If, under this impression, he proceeded to pass in review
         the several State constitutions, how great would be his disappointment to find
         that TWO ONLY of them [1] contained an interdiction of standing armies in time
         of peace;</span>
      <span class="federalism" about="elitist">that the other eleven had either observed a profound
         silence on the subject, or had in express terms admitted the right of the
         Legislature to authorize their existence.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      Still, however he would be persuaded that there must be some plausible foundation
      for
      the cry raised on this head.<span class="significantPhrase" about="elitist"> He would never be
         able to imagine, while any source of information remained unexplored, that it
         was nothing more than an experiment upon the public credulity, dictated either
         by a deliberate intention to deceive, or by the overflowings of a zeal too
         intemperate to be ingenuous.</span>
      <span class="federalism" about="elitist">It would probably occur to him, that he would be likely
         to find the precautions he was in search of in the primitive compact between the
         States.</span>
      <span class="federalism" about="elitist">Here, at length, he would expect to meet with a solution
         of the enigma. No doubt, he would observe to himself, the existing Confederation
         must contain the most explicit provisions against military establishments in
         time of peace; and a departure from this model, in a favorite point, has
         occasioned the discontent which appears to influence these political
         champions.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="federalism" about="populist">If he should now apply himself to a careful and critical
         survey of the articles of Confederation, his astonishment would not only be
         increased, but would acquire a mixture of indignation, at the unexpected
         discovery, that these articles, instead of containing the prohibition he looked
         for, and though they had, with jealous circumspection, restricted the authority
         of the State legislatures in this particular, had not imposed a single restraint
         on that of the United States.</span>
      <span class="significantPhrase" about="elitist">If he happened to be a man of quick sensibility,
         or ardent temper, he could now no longer refrain from regarding these clamors as
         the dishonest artifices of a sinister and unprincipled opposition to a plan
         which ought at least to receive a fair and candid examination from all sincere
         lovers of their country!</span>
      <span class="federalism" about="elitist">How else, he would say, could the authors of them have
         been tempted to vent such loud censures upon that plan, about a point in which
         it seems to have conformed itself to the general sense of America as declared in
         its different forms of government, and in which it has even superadded a new and
         powerful guard unknown to any of them?</span>
      <span class="liberty" about="elitist">If, on the contrary, he happened to be a man of calm and
         dispassionate feelings, he would indulge a sigh for the frailty of human nature,
         and would lament, that in a matter so interesting to the happiness of millions,
         the true merits of the question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients
         so unfriendly to an impartial and right determination.</span>
      <span class="significantPhrase" about="elitist">Even such a man could hardly forbear remarking,
         that a conduct of this kind has too much the appearance of an intention to
         mislead the people by alarming their passions, rather than to convince them by
         arguments addressed to their understandings.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      But however little this objection may be countenanced, even by precedents among
      ourselves, it may be satisfactory to take a nearer view of its intrinsic merits.
      <span class="military" about="elitist">From a close examination it will appear that restraints
         upon the discretion of the legislature in respect to military establishments in
         time of peace, would be improper to be imposed, and if imposed, from the
         necessities of society, would be unlikely to be observed.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">Though a wide ocean separates the United States from
         Europe, yet there are various considerations that warn us against an excess of
         confidence or security.</span>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">On one side of us, and stretching far into our rear,
         are growing settlements subject to the dominion of Britain.</span>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">On the other side, and extending to meet the British
         settlements, are colonies and establishments subject to the dominion of Spain.
         This situation and the vicinity of the West India Islands, belonging to these
         two powers create between them, in respect to their American possessions and in
         relation to us, a common interest.</span>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">The savage tribes on our Western frontier ought to be
         regarded as our natural enemies, their natural allies, because they have most to
         fear from us, and most to hope from them.</span>
      <span class="trade" about="elitist">The improvements in the art of navigation have, as to the
         facility of communication, rendered distant nations, in a great measure,
         neighbors.</span>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">Britain and Spain are among the principal maritime
         powers of Europe. A future concert of views between these nations ought not to
         be regarded as improbable.</span>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">The increasing remoteness of consanguinity is every
         day diminishing the force of the family compact between France and
         Spain.</span>
      <span class="significantPhrase" about="populist">And politicians have ever with great reason
         considered the ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of political
         connection.</span>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="both">These circumstances combined, admonish us not to be too
         sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the reach of
         danger.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">Previous to the Revolution, and ever since the peace, there
         has been a constant necessity for keeping small garrisons on our Western
         frontier.</span>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">No person can doubt that these will continue to be
         indispensable, if it should only be against the ravages and depredations of the
         Indians.</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">These garrisons must either be furnished by occasional
         detachments from the militia, or by permanent corps in the pay of the
         government.</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">The first is impracticable; and if practicable, would be
         pernicious. The militia would not long, if at all, submit to be dragged from
         their occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in times
         of profound peace.</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">And if they could be prevailed upon or compelled to do it,
         the increased expense of a frequent rotation of service, and the loss of labor
         and disconcertion of the industrious pursuits of individuals, would form
         conclusive objections to the scheme.</span>
      <span class="liberty" about="populist">It would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as
         ruinous to private citizens.</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">The latter resource of permanent corps in the pay of the
         government amounts to a standing army in time of peace; a small one, indeed, but
         not the less real for being small.</span>
      <span class="federalism" about="elitist">Here is a simple view of the subject, that shows us at
         once the impropriety of a constitutional interdiction of such establishments,
         and the necessity of leaving the matter to the discretion and prudence of the
         legislature.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">In proportion to our increase in strength, it is
         probable, nay, it may be said certain, that Britain and Spain would augment
         their military establishments in our neighborhood.</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">If we should not be willing to be exposed, in a naked and
         defenseless condition, to their insults and encroachments, we should find it
         expedient to increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which
         our Western settlements might be annoyed.</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">There are, and will be, particular posts, the possession of
         which will include the command of large districts of territory, and facilitate
         future invasions of the remainder.</span>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">It may be added that some of those posts will be keys
         to the trade with the Indian nations.</span>
      <span class="foreignPolicy" about="elitist">Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts
         in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two
         neighboring and formidable powers? To act this part would be to desert all the
         usual maxims of prudence and policy.</span><br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="trade" about="elitist">If we mean to be a commercial people,</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">or even to be secure on our Atlantic side, we must
         endeavor, as soon as possible, to have a navy.</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">To this purpose there must be dock-yards and arsenals; and
         for the defense of these, fortifications, and probably garrisons.</span>
      <span class="military" about="elitist">When a nation has become so powerful by sea that it can
         protect its dock-yards by its fleets, this supersedes the necessity of garrisons
         for that purpose; but where naval establishments are in their infancy, moderate
         garrisons will, in all likelihood, be found an indispensable security against
         descents for the destruction of the arsenals and dock-yards, and sometimes of
         the fleet itself.</span><br/>
