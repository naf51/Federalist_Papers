                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Do you ever wonder if politicians say what they truly believe in? We generally
                    see politicians today as persuasive orators with selfish motives to manipulate
                    their audience to believe something that is either untruthful, or real in order
                    to progress their own initiatives.</p>
                <p>This project aims to look at common belief through a historic and analytical
                    lens. We took a selection of Federalist Papers written by Alexander Hamilton and
                    examined his writing and rhetoric. We analyzed Hamilton's writing due to his
                    prominence being the father of the Federalist Party and the known motives for
                    writing the Federalist Papers.</p>
                <p><b>Our Research Question:</b></p>
                <p>How do elites such as Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers use their
                    political opinions to appeal to those of opposing ideologies of the lower and
                    working classes?</p>
                <p>As the father of the Federalist Party, which opposed important opinions of the
                    working-class, did Hamilton forgo these opinions or did he appease the
                    masses?</p>
                <p> This is a digital humanities project aimed to analyze the rhetoric of Alexander
                    Hamilton in the Federalist Papers to see if it reflected his own political
                    ideals or appealed to the masses who opposed the British Crown. </p>

                <h2>Why Are We Analyzing Documents Almost 235 Years Old?</h2>
                <p>This time period is a immensely critical stage for American democracy. As history
                    tells us, the Articles of Confederation, an attempt to correct the faults
                    associated with the British Crown, were incredibly unsuccessful. They failed to
                    maintain order and establish a federal government that had any real power, for
                    example the inability to tax and create a military left the U.S. vulnerable to
                    foes like Great Britain (which was a major contributor to the development of the
                    War of 1812.</p>
                <p>Democracy at this period of time is very fragile during the time of the
                    publication of the Federalist Papers, much like the times we live in today.
                    Democracy is still fragile after events such as those occurring on 01/06/2021.
                    So, recent fragility and increasing toxicity and fragmentation among government
                    and those identifying with political parties were huge motivators for us. In
                    addition, scholars of this period like Thomas Paine and his legendary work,
                    "Common Sense" is known to have been a tremendous influence on the support of
                    the patriot cause and rebellion against the Crown. His paper, through the help
                    of publishers in large cities such as Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia, helped
                    publish his paper and distribute it all throughout the colonies at a rapid
                    pace.</p>
                <p> Recent publication of "Colonial America in an Atlantic World", by T.H. Breen,
                    says that the political ideologies of the working people consisted of the idea
                    of an economy free from tyrannical Britain, political rights granting personal
                    freedoms, and a government structure less intense and intruding as the one of
                    Great Britain. So, during this time, the working class and majority of the
                    Colonies were supportive of people's rights and individuality, and opposed the
                    ideals of the elites like Hamilton who supported strong, centralized government
                    with the ability to tax and wage war. It is clear that history does repeat
                    itself. Because of this, we believed it be beneficial to analyze documents from
                    the past so that they can help solve potential problems occurring in the future.
                    Also, analyzing the rhetoric of elites with an intention to support opposing
                    political ideologies is relevant, regardless of what time period it took place
                    in. </p>

                <h2>Why We Chose The Federalist Papers:</h2>
                <p>Of all the politicians with a vast collective of speeches and writing, we chose
                    to analyze the Federalist Papers. Why? We chose them because of their purpose:
                    to convince the states (mainly the State of New York) to ratify the newly
                    written Constitution. It is a corpus that was intended to persuade, inform, and
                    say to the world that the newly established democracy was thoughtfully created
                    and supported by the people who developed it.</p>
                <p>More importantly, it was addressed "To the People of the State of New York:".
                    Meaning, it was intended for the people, or was it? The majority of the general
                    public during this time grew tired of Britain's tyrannical madness and desired a
                    life that granted more independence, liberties, and unconstrained
                    social/economic mobility. So, under this prevalent ideology, the Federalist
                    Papers and their author, are a prime resource to see if Hamilton's rhetoric
                    actually aligned with the Federalist Party's values, or if it appealed to the
                    masses.</p>
                <p>We also chose the Federalist Papers because "Publius", the pen name used for all
                    85 letters, is a latin term meaning, "the people". So, analyzing documents that
                    are clearly posed to be written by the public when in reality written by elites
                    is important to see whether the documents and writing is truthful and accurate
                    of individual political ideologies. It also raises the question: Did Hamilton
                    write the Federalist Papers abiding by his personal political motives aligning
                    with the Federalist Party? Or was his writing altered to appease the masses? We
                    wanted to explore this by analyzing his writing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="textbox">
                <h2>Why We Chose Alexander Hamilton:</h2>
                <p> Out of the three authors of the Federalist Papers, we chose Alexander Hamilton.
                    Why? We have three important reasons. First, he was the main contributor to the
                    Papers and their publication. Out of all 85 Federalist Papers, he wrote 51, with
                    James Madison writing 29, and John Jay writing 5. Second, he was known to be the
                    father and creator of the Federalist Party, the first established political
                    party in US history. So, his political ideology would be the closest to that
                    party's beliefs, which would be useful when considering our research question.
                    Third, much of the letters written by him were very dense and were centered
                    around important features of the newly created government. Some of these
                    features were: The Judiciary, Executive, and Legislative branches, the Bill of
                    Rights, the Military, and the powers of Taxation.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, we wanted to choose a historical figure that has had
                    posthumous fame, especially in recent years. With the sensational broadway play
                    "Hamilton", along with the biography it was based on by Ron Chernow, also named
                    "Hamilton", what better figure to choose than a modern icon that millions of
                    people have heard of and learned about his story and political career. We
                    thought it best to dive deeper into what he said using a specific corpus of
                    documents. With that, the Federalist Papers were clearly the most popular,
                    accessible, and focused corpus of documents that he wrote in his career.</p>
