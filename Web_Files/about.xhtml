            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> Do you ever question whether politicians say what they truly believe in? We
                generally see politicians today as persuasive orators with selfish motives to make
                their audience believe something that is not truthful or real seem real and
                attainable. Our research question for this project is the following: How do elites
                such as Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers apply their political ideologies
                to appeal to those of opposing ideologies of the lower and populist political
                ideals? </p>
            <p> This is a digital humanities project aimed to analyze the rhetoric of Alexander
                Hamilton in the Federalist Papers to see if it reflected his own political ideals or
                appealed to the masses who opposed the British Crown. </p>
