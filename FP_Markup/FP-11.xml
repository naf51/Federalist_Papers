            <address>To the People of the State of New York:</address>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">THE importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one
                    of those points about which there is least room to entertain a difference of
                    opinion, and which has, in fact, commanded the most general assent of men who
                    have any acquaintance with the subject.</federalism>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">This applies as well to our intercourse with foreign
                    countries as with each other.</foreignPolicy></p>
            <p><foreignPolicy type="elitist">There are appearances to authorize a supposition that
                    the adventurous spirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of America,
                    has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of
                    Europe.</foreignPolicy>
                <trade type="elitist">They seem to be apprehensive of our too great interference in
                    that carrying trade, which is the support of their navigation and the foundation
                    of their naval strength.</trade>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">Those of them which have colonies in America look
                    forward to what this country is capable of becoming, with painful
                    solicitude.</foreignPolicy>
                <military type="elitist">They foresee the dangers that may threaten their American
                    dominions from the neighborhood of States, which have all the dispositions, and
                    would possess all the means, requisite to the creation of a powerful
                    marine.</military> Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy
                of fostering divisions among us, and of depriving us, as far as possible, of an
                ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. <foreignPolicy type="elitist">This would answer
                    the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their navigation, of
                    monopolizing the profits of our trade, and of clipping the wings by which we
                    might soar to a dangerous greatness.</foreignPolicy>
                <significantPhrase type="neither"> Did not prudence forbid the detail, it would not
                    be difficult to trace, by facts, the workings of this policy to the cabinets of
                    ministers.</significantPhrase></p>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">If we continue united, we may counteract a policy so
                    unfriendly to our prosperity in a variety of ways.</federalism>
                <trade type="elitist">By prohibitory regulations, extending, at the same time,
                    throughout the States, we may oblige foreign countries to bid against each
                    other, for the privileges of our markets.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">This assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are
                    able to appreciate the importance of the markets of three millions of
                    people--increasing in rapid progression, for the most part exclusively addicted
                    to agriculture, and likely from local circumstances to remain so--to any
                    manufacturing nation</trade>; <foreignPolicy type="elitist">and the immense
                    difference there would be to the trade and navigation of such a nation, between
                    a direct communication in its own ships, and an indirect conveyance of its
                    products and returns, to and from America, in the ships of another
                    country.</foreignPolicy>
                <federalism type="elitist">Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America,
                    capable of excluding Great Britain <parenthesis>with whom we have at present no treaty of
                    commerce</parenthesis> from all our ports; what would be the probable operation of this step
                    upon her politics?</federalism>
                <trade type="elitist">Would it not enable us to negotiate, with the fairest prospect
                    of success, for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind,
                    in the dominions of that kingdom?</trade>
                <significantPhrase type="neither">When these questions have been asked, upon other
                    occasions, they have received a plausible, but not a solid or satisfactory
                    answer.</significantPhrase>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">It has been said that prohibitions on our part would
                    produce no change in the system of Britain, because she could prosecute her
                    trade with us through the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate
                    customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for the supply of
                    our markets.</foreignPolicy>
                <trade type="elitist">But would not her navigation be materially injured by the loss
                    of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade?</trade>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">Would not the principal part of its profits be
                    intercepted by the Dutch, as a compensation for their agency and
                    risk?</foreignPolicy>
                <trade type="elitist">Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a
                    considerable deduction?</trade>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">Would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the
                    competitions of other nations, by enhancing the price of British commodities in
                    our markets, and by transferring to other hands the management of this
                    interesting branch of the British commerce?</foreignPolicy></p>
            <p><foreignPolicy type="elitist">A mature consideration of the objects suggested by
                    these questions will justify a belief that the real disadvantages to Britain
                    from such a state of things, conspiring with the pre-possessions of a great part
                    of the nation in favor of the American trade,</foreignPolicy>
                <significantPhrase type="elitist">and with the importunities of the West India
                    islands,</significantPhrase>
                <trade type="elitist">would produce a relaxation in her present system, and would
                    let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those islands
                    elsewhere, from which our trade would derive the most substantial
                    benefits.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">Such a point gained from the British government, and which
                    could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our
                    markets, would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other
                    nations, who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in
                    our trade.</trade></p>
            <p><foreignPolicy type="elitist">A further resource for influencing the conduct of
                    European nations toward us, in this respect, would arise from the establishment
                    of a federal navy.</foreignPolicy>
                <federalism type="elitist">There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union
                    under an efficient government would put it in our power, at a period not very
                    distant,</federalism>
                <military type="elitist">to create a navy which, if it could not vie with those of
                    the great maritime powers, would at least be of respectable weight if thrown
                    into the scale of either of two contending parties.</military>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">This would be more peculiarly the case in relation to
                    operations in the West Indies.</foreignPolicy>
                <military type="elitist">A few ships of the line, sent opportunely to the
                    reinforcement of either side, would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a
                    campaign, on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were
                    suspended.</military>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">Our position is, in this respect, a most commanding
                    one.</foreignPolicy>
                <military type="elitist">And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness
                    of supplies from this country, in the prosecution of military operations in the
                    West Indies,</military>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">it will readily be perceived that a situation so
                    favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial
                    privileges.</foreignPolicy>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">A price would be set not only upon our friendship, but
                    upon our neutrality.</foreignPolicy>
                <federalism type="elitist">By a steady adherence to the Union we may
                    hope</federalism>, <foreignPolicy type="elitist">erelong, to become the arbiter
                    of Europe in America, and to be able to incline the balance of European
                    competitions in this part of the world as our interest may
                    dictate.</foreignPolicy></p>
            <p><foreignPolicy type="elitist">But in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall
                    discover that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each
                    other, and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly
                    placed within our reach.</foreignPolicy>
                <federalism type="elitist">In a state so insignificant our commerce would be a prey
                    to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other;</federalism>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little
                    scruple or remorse, supply their wants by depredations on our property as often
                    as it fell in their way.</foreignPolicy>
                <military type="elitist">The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they
                    are defended by an adequate power.</military>
                <federalism type="elitist">A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the
                    privilege of being neutral</federalism>.</p>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">Under a vigorous national government, the natural strength
                    and resources of the country, directed to a common interest, would baffle all
                    the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth.</federalism>
                <federalism type="elitist">This situation would even take away the motive to such
                    combinations, by inducing an impracticability of success.</federalism>
                <significantPhrase type="elitist">An active commerce, an extensive navigation, and a
                    flourishing marine would then be the offspring of moral and physical
                    necessity.</significantPhrase>
                <significantPhrase type="elitist">We might defy the little arts of the little
                    politicians to control or vary the irresistible and unchangeable course of
                    nature.</significantPhrase></p>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">But in a state of disunion, these combinations might exist
                    and might operate with success.</federalism>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">It would be in the power of the maritime nations,
                    availing themselves of our universal impotence, to prescribe the conditions of
                    our political existence;</foreignPolicy><trade type="elitist"> and as they have
                    a common interest in being our carriers, and still more in preventing our
                    becoming theirs, they would in all probability combine to embarrass our
                    navigation in such a manner as would in effect destroy it, and confine us to a
                    PASSIVE COMMERCE.</trade><trade type="elitist"> We should then be compelled to
                    content ourselves with the first price of our commodities, and to see the
                    profits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and
                    persecutors.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">That unequaled spirit of enterprise, which signalizes the
                    genius of the American merchants and navigators, and which is in itself an
                    inexhaustible mine of national wealth, would be stifled and
                    lost,</trade><federalism type="elitist"> and poverty and disgrace would
                    overspread a country which, with wisdom, might make herself the admiration and
                    envy of the world.</federalism></p>
            <p><trade type="populist">There are rights of great moment to the trade of America which
                    are rights of the Union--I allude to the fisheries, to the navigation of the
                    Western lakes, and to that of the Mississippi.</trade>
                <federalism type="elitist">The dissolution of the Confederacy would give room for
                    delicate questions concerning the future existence of these rights; which the
                    interest of more powerful partners would hardly fail to solve to our
                    disadvantage.</federalism>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">The disposition of Spain with regard to the
                    Mississippi needs no comment.</foreignPolicy> France and <foreignPolicy
                    type="elitist">Britain are concerned with us in the fisheries, and view them as
                    of the utmost moment to their navigation.</foreignPolicy>
                <trade type="elitist">They, of course, would hardly remain long indifferent to that
                    decided mastery, of which experience has shown us to be possessed in this
                    valuable branch of traffic, and by which we are able to undersell those nations
                    in their own markets.</trade>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">What more natural than that they should be disposed to
                    exclude from the lists such dangerous competitors?</foreignPolicy></p>
            <p><trade type="elitist">This branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial
                    benefit.</trade>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">All the navigating States may, in different degrees,
                    advantageously participate in it, and under circumstances of a greater extension
                    of mercantile capital, would not be unlikely to do
                    it.</foreignPolicy><significantPhrase type="elitist"> As a nursery of seamen, it
                    now is, or when time shall have more nearly assimilated the principles of
                    navigation in the several States, will become, a universal
                    resource.</significantPhrase>

                    in various ways. Every institution will grow and flourish in proportion to the

                    support.</military>
                <federalism type="elitist">A navy of the United States, as it would embrace the
                    resources of all, is an object far less remote than a navy of any single State

                    part.</federalism>
                <military type="elitist">It happens, indeed, that different portions of confederated

                    articles, it can scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the
                    latter predicament, and on this account the operations of the merchant would be
                    less liable to any considerable obstruction or
                    stagnation.</federalism><federalism type="elitist"> The speculative trader will
                    at once perceive the force of these observations, and will acknowledge that the

                    more favorable than that of the thirteen States without union or with partial
                    unions.</federalism></p>
