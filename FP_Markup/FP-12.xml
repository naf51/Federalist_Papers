            <address>To the People of the State of New York:</address>
            <p><federalism type="neither">THE effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the
                    States have been sufficiently delineated. Its tendency to promote the interests
                    of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry.</federalism></p>
            <p><trade type="elitist">The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by
                    all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most productive
                    source of national wealth, and has accordingly become a primary object of their
                    political cares.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">By multiplying the means of gratification, by promoting the
                    introduction and circulation of the precious metals, those darling objects of
                    human avarice and enterprise, it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of
                    industry, and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">The assiduous merchant, the laborious husbandman, the active
                    mechanic, and the industrious manufacturer,--all orders of men, look forward
                    with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their
                    toils.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">The often-agitated question between agriculture and commerce
                    has, from indubitable experience, received a decision which has silenced the
                    rivalship that once subsisted between them, and has proved, to the satisfaction
                    of their friends, that their interests are intimately blended and
                    interwoven.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">It has been found in various countries that, in proportion as
                    commerce has flourished, land has risen in value.</trade> And how could it have
                happened otherwise? <trade type="elitist">Could that which procures a freer vent for
                    the products of the earth, which furnishes new incitements to the cultivation of
                    land, which is the most powerful instrument in increasing the quantity of money
                    in a state--could that, in fine, which is the faithful handmaid of labor and
                    industry, in every shape, fail to augment that article, which is the prolific
                    parent of far the greatest part of the objects upon which they are
                    exerted?</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">It is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have had
                    an adversary; and it is one, among a multitude of proofs, how apt a spirit of
                    ill-informed jealousy, or of too great abstraction and refinement, is to lead
                    men astray from the plainest truths of reason and conviction.</trade></p>
            <p><taxation type="elitist">The ability of a country to pay taxes must always be
                    proportioned, in a great degree, to the quantity of money in circulation, and to
                    the celerity with which it circulates.</taxation>
                <taxation type="elitist">Commerce, contributing to both these objects, must of
                    necessity render the payment of taxes easier, and facilitate the requisite
                    supplies to the treasury.</taxation>
                <historicalComparison type="elitist">The hereditary dominions of the Emperor of
                    Germany contain a great extent of fertile, cultivated, and populous territory, a
                    large proportion of which is situated in mild and luxuriant climates. In some
                    parts of this territory are to be found the best gold and silver mines in
                    Europe.</historicalComparison>
                <trade type="elitist">And yet, from the want of the fostering influence of commerce,
                    that monarch can boast but slender revenues.</trade>
                <historicalComparison type="elitist">He has several times been compelled to owe
                    obligations to the pecuniary succors of other nations for the preservation of
                    his essential interests, and is unable, upon the strength of his own resources,
                    to sustain a long or continued war.</historicalComparison></p>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">But it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that
                    Union will be seen to conduce to the purpose of revenue.</federalism> There are
                other points of view, in which its influence will appear more immediate and
                decisive. <taxation type="elitist">It is evident from the state of the country, from
                    the habits of the people, from the experience we have had on the point itself,
                    that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct
                    taxation.</taxation>
                <taxation type="elitist">Tax laws have in vain been multiplied; new methods to
                    enforce the collection have in vain been tried; the public expectation has been
                    uniformly disappointed, and the treasuries of the States have remained
                    empty.</taxation>
                <taxation type="elitist">The popular system of administration inherent in the nature
                    of popular government, coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a
                    languid and mutilated state of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for
                    extensive collections, and has at length taught the different legislatures the
                    folly of attempting them.</taxation></p>
            <p><historicalComparison type="elitist">No person acquainted with what happens in other
                    countries will be surprised at this circumstance.</historicalComparison>
                <historicalComparison type="elitist">In so opulent a nation as that of Britain,
                    where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much more tolerable, and, from
                    the vigor of the government, much more practicable, than in America, far the
                    greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect
                    kind, from imposts, and from excises.</historicalComparison>
                <trade type="elitist">Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter
                    description.</trade></p>
            <p><trade type="elitist">In America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for
                    the means of revenue chiefly on such duties.</trade> In most parts of it,
                excises must be confined within a narrow compass. <significantPhrase type="populist"
                    >The genius of the people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit
                    of excise laws.</significantPhrase>
                <taxation type="populist">The pockets of the farmers, on the other hand, will
                    reluctantly yield but scanty supplies, in the unwelcome shape of impositions on
                    their houses and lands; and personal property is too precarious and invisible a
                    fund to be laid hold of in any other way than by the inperceptible agency of
                    taxes on consumption.</taxation></p>
            <p><taxation type="elitist">If these remarks have any foundation, that state of things
                    which will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource must be
                    best adapted to our political welfare.</taxation>
                <federalism type="elitist">And it cannot admit of a serious doubt, that this state
                    of things must rest on the basis of a general Union.</federalism>
                <trade type="elitist">As far as this would be conducive to the interests of
                    commerce, so far it must tend to the extension of the revenue to be drawn from
                    that source.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">As far as it would contribute to rendering regulations for the
                    collection of the duties more simple and efficacious, so far it must serve to
                    answer the purposes of making the same rate of duties more productive, and of
                    putting it into the power of the government to increase the rate without
                    prejudice to trade.</trade></p>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">The relative situation of these States; the number of
                    rivers with which they are intersected, and of bays that wash there shores; the
                    facility of communication in every direction; the affinity of language and
                    manners; the familiar habits of intercourse;</federalism> --<trade
                    type="elitist">all these are circumstances that would conspire to render an
                    illicit trade between them a matter of little difficulty, and would insure
                    frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other.</trade>
                <federalism type="elitist">The separate States or confederacies would be
                    necessitated by mutual jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade
                    by the lowness of their duties.</federalism>
                <federalism type="elitist">The temper of our governments, for a long time to come,
                    would not permit those rigorous precautions by which the European nations guard
                    the avenues into their respective countries, as well by land as by
                    water;</federalism>
                <trade type="elitist">and which, even there, are found insufficient obstacles to the
                    adventurous stratagems of avarice.</trade></p>
            <p><historicalComparison type="elitist">In France, there is an army of patrols
                        <parenthesis>as they are called</parenthesis> constantly employed to secure
                    their fiscal regulations against the inroads of the dealers in contraband
                    trade.</historicalComparison> Mr. Neckar computes the number of these patrols at
                upwards of twenty thousand. <trade type="elitist">This shows the immense difficulty
                    in preventing that species of traffic, where there is an inland communication,
                    and places in a strong light the disadvantages with which the collection of
                    duties in this country would be encumbered,</trade>
                <federalism type="elitist">if by disunion the States should be placed in a
                    situation, with respect to each other, resembling that of France with respect to
                    her neighbors.</federalism>
                <historicalComparison type="elitist">The arbitrary and vexatious powers with which
                    the patrols are necessarily armed, would be intolerable in a free
                    country.</historicalComparison></p>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">If, on the contrary, there be but one government pervading
                    all the States, there will be, as to the principal part of our commerce, but ONE
                    SIDE to guard--the ATLANTIC COAST.</federalism>
                <trade type="elitist">Vessels arriving directly from foreign countries, laden with
                    valuable cargoes, would rarely choose to hazard themselves to the complicated
                    and critical perils which would attend attempts to unlade prior to their coming
                    into port.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">They would have to dread both the dangers of the coast, and of
                    detection, as well after as before their arrival at the places of their final
                    destination.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">An ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the
                    prevention of any material infractions upon the rights of the revenue.</trade>
                <military type="elitist">A few armed vessels, judiciously stationed at the entrances
                    of our ports, might at a small expense be made useful sentinels of the
                    laws.</military>
                <federalism type="elitist">And the government having the same interest to provide
                    against violations everywhere, the co-operation of its measures in each State
                    would have a powerful tendency to render them effectual.</federalism>
                <federalism type="elitist">Here also we should preserve by Union, an advantage which
                    nature holds out to us, and which would be relinquished by
                    separation.</federalism>
                <trade type="elitist">The United States lie at a great distance from Europe, and at
                    a considerable distance from all other places with which they would have
                    extensive connections of foreign trade.</trade>
                <historicalComparison type="elitist">The passage from them to us, in a few hours, or
                    in a single night, as between the coasts of France and Britain, and of other
                    neighboring nations, would be impracticable.</historicalComparison>
                <trade type="elitist">This is a prodigious security against a direct contraband with
                    foreign countries; but a circuitous contraband to one State, through the medium
                    of another, would be both easy and safe.</trade>
                <foreignPolicy type="elitist">The difference between a direct importation from
                    abroad, and an indirect importation through the channel of a neighboring State,
                    in small parcels, according to time and opportunity, with the additional
                    facilities of inland communication, must be palpable to every man of
                    discernment.</foreignPolicy></p>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">It is therefore evident, that one national government
                    would be able, at much less expense, to extend the duties on imports, beyond
                    comparison, further than would be practicable to the States separately, or to
                    any partial confederacies.</federalism>
                <trade type="neither">Hitherto, I believe, it may safely be asserted, that these
                    duties have not upon an average exceeded in any State three per cent.</trade>
                <historicalComparison type="neither">In France they are estimated to be about
                    fifteen per cent., and in Britain they exceed this
                    proportion.</historicalComparison>
                <trade type="elitist">There seems to be nothing to hinder their being increased in
                    this country to at least treble their present amount.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">The single article of ardent spirits, under federal
                    regulation, might be made to furnish a considerable revenue.</trade>
                <trade type="elitist">Upon a ratio to the importation into this State, the whole
                    quantity imported into the United States may be estimated at four millions of
                    gallons; which, at a shilling per gallon, would produce two hundred thousand
                    pounds.</trade>
                <federalism type="elitist">That article would well bear this rate of duty; and if it
                    should tend to diminish the consumption of it, such an effect would be equally
                    favorable to the agriculture, to the economy, to the morals, and to the health
                    of the society.</federalism>
                <significantPhrase type="neither">There is, perhaps, nothing so much a subject of
                    national extravagance as these spirits.</significantPhrase></p>
            <p><significantPhrase type="elitist">What will be the consequence, if we are not able to
                    avail ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent? A nation cannot
                    long exist without revenues.</significantPhrase>
                <trade type="elitist">Destitute of this essential support, it must resign its
                    independence, and sink into the degraded condition of a province.</trade>
                    T<trade type="elitist">his is an extremity to which no government will of choice
                    accede. Revenue, therefore, must be had at all events. In this country, if the
                    principal part be not drawn from commerce, it must fall with oppressive weight
                    upon land.</trade>
                <taxation type="populist">It has been already intimated that excises, in their true
                    signification, are too little in unison with the feelings of the people, to
                    admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation; nor, indeed, in the
                    States where almost the sole employment is agriculture, are the objects proper
                    for excise sufficiently numerous to permit very ample collections in that
                    way.</taxation>
                <taxation type="elitist">Personal estate <parenthesis>as has been before
                        remarked</parenthesis>, from the difficulty in tracing it, cannot be
                    subjected to large contributions, by any other means than by taxes on
                    consumption.</taxation>
                <taxation type="elitist">In populous cities, it may be enough the subject of
                    conjecture, to occasion the oppression of individuals, without much aggregate
                    benefit to the State; but beyond these circles, it must, in a great measure,
                    escape the eye and the hand of the tax-gatherer.</taxation>
                <taxation type="elitist">As the necessities of the State, nevertheless, must be
                    satisfied in some mode or other, the defect of other resources must throw the
                    principal weight of public burdens on the possessors of land.</taxation>
                <federalism type="elitist">And as, on the other hand, the wants of the government
                    can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the sources of revenue are open
                    to its demands, the finances of the community, under such embarrassments, cannot
                    be put into a situation consistent with its respectability or its
                    security.</federalism>
                <taxation type="elitist">Thus we shall not even have the consolations of a full
                    treasury, to atone for the oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who
                    are employed in the cultivation of the soil.</taxation>
                <federalism type="elitist">But public and private distress will keep pace with each
                    other in gloomy concert; and unite in deploring the infatuation of those
                    counsels which led to disunion.</federalism></p>
