            <address>To the People of the State of New York:</address>
            <p>As CONNECTED with the subject of revenue, we may with propriety consider that of
                economy. <taxation type="elitist">The money saved from one object may be usefully
                    applied to another, and there will be so much the less to be drawn from the
                    pockets of the people.</taxation>
                <federalism type="elitist">If the States are united under one government, there will
                    be but one national civil list to support; if they are divided into several
                    confederacies, there will be as many different national civil lists to be
                    provided for--and each of them, as to the principal departments, coextensive
                    with that which would be necessary for a government of the whole.</federalism>
                <federalism type="elitist">The entire separation of the States into thirteen
                    unconnected sovereignties is a project too extravagant and too replete with
                    danger to have many advocates.</federalism>
                <federalism type="neither">The ideas of men who speculate upon the dismemberment of
                    the empire seem generally turned toward three confederacies--one consisting of
                    the four Northern, another of the four Middle, and a third of the five Southern
                    States.</federalism> There is little probability that there would be a greater
                number. <significantPhrase type="neither">According to this distribution, each
                    confederacy would comprise an extent of territory larger than that of the
                    kingdom of Great Britain.</significantPhrase>
                <federalism type="elitist">No well-informed man will suppose that the affairs of
                    such a confederacy can be properly regulated by a government less comprehensive
                    in its organs or institutions than that which has been proposed by the
                    convention.</federalism>
                <federalism type="elitist">When the dimensions of a State attain to a certain
                    magnitude, it requires the same energy of government and the same forms of
                    administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent.</federalism>
                This idea admits not of precise demonstration, because there is no rule by which we
                can measure the momentum of civil power necessary to the government of any given
                number of individuals; <historicalComparison type="elitist">but when we consider
                    that the island of Britain, nearly commensurate with each of the supposed
                    confederacies, contains about eight millions of people, and when we reflect upon
                    the degree of authority required to direct the passions of so large a society to
                    the public good, we shall see no reason to doubt that the like portion of power
                    would be sufficient to perform the same task in a society far more
                    numerous.</historicalComparison>
                <federalism type="elitist">Civil power, properly organized and exerted, is capable
                    of diffusing its force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce
                    itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate
                    institutions.</federalism></p>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">The supposition that each confederacy into which the
                    States would be likely to be divided would require a government not less
                    comprehensive than the one proposed, will be strengthened by another
                    supposition, more probable than that which presents us with three confederacies
                    as the alternative to a general Union.</federalism>
                <federalism type="elitist">If we attend carefully to geographical and commercial
                    considerations, in conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the different
                    States, we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they will most
                    naturally league themselves under two governments.</federalism>
                <significantPhrase type="neither">The four Eastern States, from all the causes that
                    form the links of national sympathy and connection, may with certainty be
                    expected to unite. New York, situated as she is, would never be unwise enough to
                    oppose a feeble and unsupported flank to the weight of that
                    confederacy.</significantPhrase> There are other obvious reasons that would
                facilitate her accession to it. <significantPhrase type="neither">New Jersey is too
                    small a State to think of being a frontier, in opposition to this still more
                    powerful combination; nor do there appear to be any obstacles to her admission
                    into it. Even Pennsylvania would have strong inducements to join the Northern
                    league.</significantPhrase>
                <trade type="elitist">An active foreign commerce, on the basis of her own
                    navigation, is her true policy, and coincides with the opinions and dispositions
                    of her citizens.</trade>
                <significantPhrase type="elitist">The more Southern States, from various
                    circumstances, may not think themselves much interested in the encouragement of
                    navigation.</significantPhrase>
                <trade type="elitist">They may prefer a system which would give unlimited scope to
                    all nations to be the carriers as well as the purchasers of their
                    commodities.</trade>
                <significantPhrase type="neither">Pennsylvania may not choose to confound her
                    interests in a connection so adverse to her policy. As she must at all events be
                    a frontier, she may deem it most consistent with her safety to have her exposed
                    side turned towards the weaker power of the Southern, rather than towards the
                    stronger power of the Northern, Confederacy.</significantPhrase>
                <significantPhrase type="elitist">This would give her the fairest chance to avoid
                    being the Flanders of America. Whatever may be the determination of
                    Pennsylvania, if the Northern Confederacy includes New Jersey, there is no
                    likelihood of more than one confederacy to the south of that
                    State.</significantPhrase></p>
            <p><federalism type="elitist">Nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen States
                    will be able to support a national government better than one half, or one
                    third, or any number less than the whole.</federalism>
                <significantPhrase type="elitist"> This reflection must have great weight in
                    obviating that objection to the proposed plan, which is founded on the principle
                    of expense; an objection, however, which, when we come to take a nearer view of
                    it, will appear in every light to stand on mistaken
                ground.</significantPhrase></p>
            <p><trade type="elitist">If, in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil
                    lists, we take into view the number of persons who must necessarily be employed
                    to guard the inland communication between the different confederacies against
                    illicit trade, and who in time will infallibly spring up out of the necessities
                    of revenue;</trade>
                <military type="elitist">and if we also take into view the military establishments
                    which it has been shown would unavoidably result from the jealousies and
                    conflicts of the several nations into which the States would be
                    divided,</military>
                <federalism type="elitist">we shall clearly discover that a separation would be not
                    less injurious to the economy, than to the tranquillity, commerce, revenue, and
                    liberty of every part.</federalism></p>
