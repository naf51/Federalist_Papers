# 10/6 Element Tagging (Federalist Papers)

Hamilton wrote and contributed to 59 papers in total, some of which were co-written by James Madison. He wrote the following papers: 1, 6-9, 11-13, 15-17, 18-20 (Assisted by James Madison) 21-36, 49-57 (Assisted by James Madison), 59-61, 62-63?, 65-85. 

Hamilton in paper No. 1 gives an outline for the rest of the papers, dividing them into 6 (unequal) sections. They are:

1. "The utility of the UNION to your political prosperity" — covered in No. 2 through No. 14
2. "The insufficiency of the present Confederation to preserve that Union" — covered in No. 15 through No. 22
3. "The necessity of a government at least equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this object" — covered in No. 23 through No. 36
4. "The conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government" — covered in No. 37 through No. 84
5. "Its analogy to your own state constitution" — covered in No. 85
6. "The additional security which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government, to liberty and to prosperity" — covered in No. 85.

### Element Tagging

Using Hamilton's sections provided, we divide the papers and markup equally amongst ourselves.

Each paper has a general theme regarding an aspect of government. This may be things like:
Judiciary, Military, Freedom and Rights, Government Operations, etc.

Our elements would consist of topics covered like `<judiciary>`, `<Freedom>` `<Military>`, `<Economy>` `<Government Power>` `<Taxation>`, etc. 

Depending on the content and viewpoint that Hamilton gives, we attribute those elements as either being
"populist" or "elitist", so it would look like `<judiciary stance = "populist"> text </judiciary>`
We would individually go through his letters and complete the markup. We then have a large 
data set we can work with. We could come up with figures on the percentage of Hamilton's opinion on a certain issue and graph them. 

This could make network analysis very easy or very difficult, as I am unsure of the details, but there is the potential to do both. I don't think it would be difficult to do since there are topics/themes to the papers and if we narrow them down we can use them as the main contributors to the network analysis portion of the project.
