    <p>The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection</p>
    <p>For the Independent Journal.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>A FIRM Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the States, as a
        barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. It is impossible to read the history of
        the petty republics of Greece and Italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at
        the distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid succession of
        revolutions by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes
        of tyranny and anarchy. If they exhibit occasional calms, these only serve as short-lived
        contrast to the furious storms that are to succeed. If now and then intervals of felicity
        open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the
        pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition
        and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us
        with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that
        the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright
        talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so
        justly celebrated.</p>
      <p>From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the advocates of despotism
        have drawn arguments, not only against the forms of republican government, but against the
        very principles of civil liberty. They have decried all free government as inconsistent with
        the order of society, and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation over its friends
        and partisans. Happily for mankind, stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty, which
        have flourished for ages, have, in a few glorious instances, refuted their gloomy sophisms.
        And, I trust, America will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices, not less
        magnificent, which will be equally permanent monuments of their errors.</p>
      <p>But it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of republican government
        were too just copies of the originals from which they were taken. If it had been found
        impracticable to have devised models of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends to
        liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of government as
        indefensible. The science of politics, however, like most other sciences, has received great
        improvement. The efficacy of various principles is now well understood, which were either
        not known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular distribution of power
        into distinct departments; the introduction of legislative balances and checks; the
        institution of courts composed of judges holding their offices during good behavior; the
        representation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election: these are
        wholly new discoveries, or have made their principal progress towards perfection in modern
        times. They are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government
        may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided. To this catalogue of
        circumstances that tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government, I shall
        venture, however novel it may appear to some, to add one more, on a principle which has been
        made the foundation of an objection to the new Constitution; I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the
        ORBIT within which such systems are to revolve, either in respect to the dimensions of a
        single State or to the consolidation of several smaller States into one great Confederacy.
        The latter is that which immediately concerns the object under consideration. It will,
        however, be of use to examine the principle in its application to a single State, which
        shall be attended to in another place.</p>
      <p>The utility of a Confederacy, as well to suppress faction and to guard the internal
        tranquillity of States, as to increase their external force and security, is in reality not
        a new idea. It has been practiced upon in different countries and ages, and has received the
        sanction of the most approved writers on the subject of politics. The opponents of the plan
        proposed have, with great assiduity, cited and circulated the observations of Montesquieu on
        the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government. But they seem not to
        have been apprised of the sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his
        work, nor to have adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they subscribe with
        such ready acquiescence.</p>
      <p>When Montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics, the standards he had in view were
        of dimensions far short of the limits of almost every one of these States. Neither Virginia,
        Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, nor Georgia can by any means be
        compared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms of his description
        apply. If we therefore take his ideas on this point as the criterion of truth, we shall be
        driven to the alternative either of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy, or of
        splitting ourselves into an infinity of little, jealous, clashing, tumultuous commonwealths,
        the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord, and the miserable objects of universal pity or
        contempt. Some of the writers who have come forward on the other side of the question seem
        to have been aware of the dilemma; and have even been bold enough to hint at the division of
        the larger States as a desirable thing. Such an infatuated policy, such a desperate
        expedient, might, by the multiplication of petty offices, answer the views of men who
        possess not qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles of personal
        intrigue, but it could never promote the greatness or happiness of the people of
        America.</p>
      <p>Referring the examination of the principle itself to another place, as has been already
        mentioned, it will be sufficient to remark here that, in the sense of the author who has
        been most emphatically quoted upon the occasion, it would only dictate a reduction of the
        SIZE of the more considerable MEMBERS of the Union, but would not militate against their
        being all comprehended in one confederate government. And this is the true question, in the
        discussion of which we are at present interested.</p>
      <p>So far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing in opposition to a general Union of
        the States, that he explicitly treats of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC as the expedient for
        extending the sphere of popular government, and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with
        those of republicanism. "It is very probable," (says he1) "that mankind would have been
        obliged at length to live constantly under the government of a single person, had they not
        contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a republican,
        together with the external force of a monarchical government. I mean a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC.
        "This form of government is a convention by which several smaller STATES agree to become
        members of a larger ONE, which they intend to form. It is a kind of assemblage of societies
        that constitute a new one, capable of increasing, by means of new associations, till they
        arrive to such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the united
        body. "A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may support itself
        without any internal corruptions. The form of this society prevents all manner of
        inconveniences. "If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority, he could
        not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate states. Were he
        to have too great influence over one, this would alarm the rest. Were he to subdue a part,
        that which would still remain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which
        he had usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his usurpation. "Should a
        popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states the others are able to quell
        it. Should abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound. The
        state may be destroyed on one side, and not on the other; the confederacy may be dissolved,
        and the confederates preserve their sovereignty. "As this government is composed of small
        republics, it enjoys the internal happiness of each; and with respect to its external
        situation, it is possessed, by means of the association, of all the advantages of large
        monarchies."</p>
      <p>I have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages, because they
        contain a luminous abridgment of the principal arguments in favor of the Union, and must
        effectually remove the false impressions which a misapplication of other parts of the work
        was calculated to make. They have, at the same time, an intimate connection with the more
        immediate design of this paper; which is, to illustrate the tendency of the Union to repress
        domestic faction and insurrection.</p>
      <p>A distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been raised between a CONFEDERACY and a
        CONSOLIDATION of the States. The essential characteristic of the first is said to be, the
        restriction of its authority to the members in their collective capacities, without reaching
        to the individuals of whom they are composed. It is contended that the national council
        ought to have no concern with any object of internal administration. An exact equality of
        suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a
        confederate government. These positions are, in the main, arbitrary; they are supported
        neither by principle nor precedent. It has indeed happened, that governments of this kind
        have generally operated in the manner which the distinction taken notice of, supposes to be
        inherent in their nature; but there have been in most of them extensive exceptions to the
        practice, which serve to prove, as far as example will go, that there is no absolute rule on
        the subject. And it will be clearly shown in the course of this investigation that as far as
        the principle contended for has prevailed, it has been the cause of incurable disorder and
        imbecility in the government.</p>
      <p>The definition of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC seems simply to be "an assemblage of societies,"
        or an association of two or more states into one state. The extent, modifications, and
        objects of the federal authority are mere matters of discretion. So long as the separate
        organization of the members be not abolished; so long as it exists, by a constitutional
        necessity, for local purposes; though it should be in perfect subordination to the general
        authority of the union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states,
        or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the State
        governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty, by allowing them a
        direct representation in the Senate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and
        very important portions of sovereign power. This fully corresponds, in every rational import
        of the terms, with the idea of a federal government.</p>
      <p>In the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty-three CITIES or republics, the largest
        were entitled to THREE votes in the COMMON COUNCIL, those of the middle class to TWO, and
        the smallest to ONE. The COMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and
        magistrates of the respective CITIES. This was certainly the most, delicate species of
        interference in their internal administration; for if there be any thing that seems
        exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions, it is the appointment of their own
        officers. Yet Montesquieu, speaking of this association, says: "Were I to give a model of an
        excellent Confederate Republic, it would be that of Lycia." Thus we perceive that the
        distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this enlightened civilian;
        and we shall be led to conclude, that they are the novel refinements of an erroneous
        theory.</p>

    <p>The Utility of the Union in Respect to Commercial Relations and a Navy</p>
    <p>For the Independent Journal.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one of those points about which
        there is least room to entertain a difference of opinion, and which has, in fact, commanded
        the most general assent of men who have any acquaintance with the subject. This applies as
        well to our intercourse with foreign countries as with each other.</p>
      <p>There are appearances to authorize a supposition that the adventurous spirit, which
        distinguishes the commercial character of America, has already excited uneasy sensations in
        several of the maritime powers of Europe. They seem to be apprehensive of our too great
        interference in that carrying trade, which is the support of their navigation and the
        foundation of their naval strength. Those of them which have colonies in America look
        forward to what this country is capable of becoming, with painful solicitude. They foresee
        the dangers that may threaten their American dominions from the neighborhood of States,
        which have all the dispositions, and would possess all the means, requisite to the creation
        of a powerful marine. Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of
        fostering divisions among us, and of depriving us, as far as possible, of an ACTIVE COMMERCE
        in our own bottoms. This would answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference
        in their navigation, of monopolizing the profits of our trade, and of clipping the wings by
        which we might soar to a dangerous greatness. Did not prudence forbid the detail, it would
        not be difficult to trace, by facts, the workings of this policy to the cabinets of
        ministers.</p>
      <p>If we continue united, we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our prosperity in a
        variety of ways. By prohibitory regulations, extending, at the same time, throughout the
        States, we may oblige foreign countries to bid against each other, for the privileges of our
        markets. This assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to appreciate the
        importance of the markets of three millions of people--increasing in rapid progression, for
        the most part exclusively addicted to agriculture, and likely from local circumstances to
        remain so--to any manufacturing nation; and the immense difference there would be to the
        trade and navigation of such a nation, between a direct communication in its own ships, and
        an indirect conveyance of its products and returns, to and from America, in the ships of
        another country. Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America, capable of excluding
        Great Britain (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our ports; what
        would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics? Would it not enable us to
        negotiate, with the fairest prospect of success, for commercial privileges of the most
        valuable and extensive kind, in the dominions of that kingdom? When these questions have
        been asked, upon other occasions, they have received a plausible, but not a solid or
        satisfactory answer. It has been said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change
        in the system of Britain, because she could prosecute her trade with us through the medium
        of the Dutch, who would be her immediate customers and paymasters for those articles which
        were wanted for the supply of our markets. But would not her navigation be materially
        injured by the loss of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade? Would
        not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the Dutch, as a compensation for
        their agency and risk? Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable
        deduction? Would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the competitions of other
        nations, by enhancing the price of British commodities in our markets, and by transferring
        to other hands the management of this interesting branch of the British commerce?</p>
      <p>A mature consideration of the objects suggested by these questions will justify a belief
        that the real disadvantages to Britain from such a state of things, conspiring with the
        pre-possessions of a great part of the nation in favor of the American trade, and with the
        importunities of the West India islands, would produce a relaxation in her present system,
        and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those islands elsewhere,
        from which our trade would derive the most substantial benefits. Such a point gained from
        the British government, and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions
        and immunities in our markets, would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct
        of other nations, who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our
        trade.</p>
      <p>A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us, in this
        respect, would arise from the establishment of a federal navy. There can be no doubt that
        the continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it in our power, at a
        period not very distant, to create a navy which, if it could not vie with those of the great
        maritime powers, would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either
        of two contending parties. This would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations
        in the West Indies. A few ships of the line, sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either
        side, would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the event of which
        interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended. Our position is, in this respect, a most
        commanding one. And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from
        this country, in the prosecution of military operations in the West Indies, it will readily
        be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage
        for commercial privileges. A price would be set not only upon our friendship, but upon our
        neutrality. By a steady adherence to the Union we may hope, erelong, to become the arbiter
        of Europe in America, and to be able to incline the balance of European competitions in this
        part of the world as our interest may dictate.</p>
      <p>But in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall discover that the rivalships of the
        parts would make them checks upon each other, and would frustrate all the tempting
        advantages which nature has kindly placed within our reach. In a state so insignificant our
        commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other;
        who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little scruple or remorse, supply their
        wants by depredations on our property as often as it fell in their way. The rights of
        neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation,
        despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral.</p>
      <p>Under a vigorous national government, the natural strength and resources of the country,
        directed to a common interest, would baffle all the combinations of European jealousy to
        restrain our growth. This situation would even take away the motive to such combinations, by
        inducing an impracticability of success. An active commerce, an extensive navigation, and a
        flourishing marine would then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity. We might
        defy the little arts of the little politicians to control or vary the irresistible and
        unchangeable course of nature.</p>
      <p>But in a state of disunion, these combinations might exist and might operate with success.
        It would be in the power of the maritime nations, availing themselves of our universal
        impotence, to prescribe the conditions of our political existence; and as they have a common
        interest in being our carriers, and still more in preventing our becoming theirs, they would
        in all probability combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in effect
        destroy it, and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We should then be compelled to content
        ourselves with the first price of our commodities, and to see the profits of our trade
        snatched from us to enrich our enemies and persecutors. That unequaled spirit of enterprise,
        which signalizes the genius of the American merchants and navigators, and which is in itself
        an inexhaustible mine of national wealth, would be stifled and lost, and poverty and
        disgrace would overspread a country which, with wisdom, might make herself the admiration
        and envy of the world.</p>
      <p>There are rights of great moment to the trade of America which are rights of the Union--I
        allude to the fisheries, to the navigation of the Western lakes, and to that of the
        Mississippi. The dissolution of the Confederacy would give room for delicate questions
        concerning the future existence of these rights; which the interest of more powerful
        partners would hardly fail to solve to our disadvantage. The disposition of Spain with
        regard to the Mississippi needs no comment. France and Britain are concerned with us in the
        fisheries, and view them as of the utmost moment to their navigation. They, of course, would
        hardly remain long indifferent to that decided mastery, of which experience has shown us to
        be possessed in this valuable branch of traffic, and by which we are able to undersell those
        nations in their own markets. What more natural than that they should be disposed to exclude
        from the lists such dangerous competitors?</p>
      <p>This branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial benefit. All the navigating
        States may, in different degrees, advantageously participate in it, and under circumstances
        of a greater extension of mercantile capital, would not be unlikely to do it. As a nursery
        of seamen, it now is, or when time shall have more nearly assimilated the principles of
        navigation in the several States, will become, a universal resource. To the establishment of
        a navy, it must be indispensable.</p>
      <p>To this great national object, a NAVY, union will contribute in various ways. Every
        institution will grow and flourish in proportion to the quantity and extent of the means
        concentred towards its formation and support. A navy of the United States, as it would
        embrace the resources of all, is an object far less remote than a navy of any single State
        or partial confederacy, which would only embrace the resources of a single part. It happens,
        indeed, that different portions of confederated America possess each some peculiar advantage
        for this essential establishment. The more southern States furnish in greater abundance
        certain kinds of naval stores--tar, pitch, and turpentine. Their wood for the construction
        of ships is also of a more solid and lasting texture. The difference in the duration of the
        ships of which the navy might be composed, if chiefly constructed of Southern wood, would be
        of signal importance, either in the view of naval strength or of national economy. Some of
        the Southern and of the Middle States yield a greater plenty of iron, and of better quality.
        Seamen must chiefly be drawn from the Northern hive. The necessity of naval protection to
        external or maritime commerce does not require a particular elucidation, no more than the
        conduciveness of that species of commerce to the prosperity of a navy.</p>
      <p>An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each by
        an interchange of their respective productions, not only for the supply of reciprocal wants
        at home, but for exportation to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every part will be
        replenished, and will acquire additional motion and vigor from a free circulation of the
        commodities of every part. Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope, from the
        diversity in the productions of different States. When the staple of one fails from a bad
        harvest or unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the staple of another. The variety, not
        less than the value, of products for exportation contributes to the activity of foreign
        commerce. It can be conducted upon much better terms with a large number of materials of a
        given value than with a small number of materials of the same value; arising from the
        competitions of trade and from the fluctations of markets. Particular articles may be in
        great demand at certain periods, and unsalable at others; but if there be a variety of
        articles, it can scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter
        predicament, and on this account the operations of the merchant would be less liable to any
        considerable obstruction or stagnation. The speculative trader will at once perceive the
        force of these observations, and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce
        of the United States would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the thirteen
        States without union or with partial unions.</p>
      <p>It may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the States are united or disunited, there
        would still be an intimate intercourse between them which would answer the same ends; this
        intercourse would be fettered, interrupted, and narrowed by a multiplicity of causes, which
        in the course of these papers have been amply detailed. A unity of commercial, as well as
        political, interests, can only result from a unity of government.</p>
      <p>There are other points of view in which this subject might be placed, of a striking and
        animating kind. But they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity, and would
        involve topics not proper for a newspaper discussion. I shall briefly observe, that our
        situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an ascendant in the system of
        American affairs. The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four
        parts, each having a distinct set of interests. Unhappily for the other three, Europe, by
        her arms and by her negotiations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended
        her dominion over them all. Africa, Asia, and America, have successively felt her
        domination. The superiority she has long maintained has tempted her to plume herself as the
        Mistress of the World, and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit. Men
        admired as profound philosophers have, in direct terms, attributed to her inhabitants a
        physical superiority, and have gravely asserted that all animals, and with them the human
        species, degenerate in America--that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in
        our atmosphere.1 Facts have too long supported these arrogant pretensions of the Europeans.
        It belongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race, and to teach that assuming
        brother, moderation. Union will enable us to do it. Disunion will will add another victim to
        his triumphs. Let Americans disdain to be the instruments of European greatness! Let the
        thirteen States, bound together in a strict and indissoluble Union, concur in erecting one
        great American system, superior to the control of all transatlantic force or influence, and
        able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world!</p>

    <p>The Utility of the Union In Respect to Revenue</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet.</p>
    <p>Tuesday, November 27, 1787.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the States have been sufficiently
        delineated. Its tendency to promote the interests of revenue will be the subject of our
        present inquiry.</p>
      <p>The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all enlightened statesmen
        to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth, and has
        accordingly become a primary object of their political cares. By multiplying the means of
        gratification, by promoting the introduction and circulation of the precious metals, those
        darling objects of human avarice and enterprise, it serves to vivify and invigorate the
        channels of industry, and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness. The
        assiduous merchant, the laborious husbandman, the active mechanic, and the industrious
        manufacturer,--all orders of men, look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity
        to this pleasing reward of their toils. The often-agitated question between agriculture and
        commerce has, from indubitable experience, received a decision which has silenced the
        rivalship that once subsisted between them, and has proved, to the satisfaction of their
        friends, that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven. It has been found in
        various countries that, in proportion as commerce has flourished, land has risen in value.
        And how could it have happened otherwise? Could that which procures a freer vent for the
        products of the earth, which furnishes new incitements to the cultivation of land, which is
        the most powerful instrument in increasing the quantity of money in a state--could that, in
        fine, which is the faithful handmaid of labor and industry, in every shape, fail to augment
        that article, which is the prolific parent of far the greatest part of the objects upon
        which they are exerted? It is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have had an
        adversary; and it is one, among a multitude of proofs, how apt a spirit of ill-informed
        jealousy, or of too great abstraction and refinement, is to lead men astray from the
        plainest truths of reason and conviction.</p>
      <p>The ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned, in a great degree, to
        the quantity of money in circulation, and to the celerity with which it circulates.
        Commerce, contributing to both these objects, must of necessity render the payment of taxes
        easier, and facilitate the requisite supplies to the treasury. The hereditary dominions of
        the Emperor of Germany contain a great extent of fertile, cultivated, and populous
        territory, a large proportion of which is situated in mild and luxuriant climates. In some
        parts of this territory are to be found the best gold and silver mines in Europe. And yet,
        from the want of the fostering influence of commerce, that monarch can boast but slender
        revenues. He has several times been compelled to owe obligations to the pecuniary succors of
        other nations for the preservation of his essential interests, and is unable, upon the
        strength of his own resources, to sustain a long or continued war.</p>
      <p>But it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that Union will be seen to conduce to the
        purpose of revenue. There are other points of view, in which its influence will appear more
        immediate and decisive. It is evident from the state of the country, from the habits of the
        people, from the experience we have had on the point itself, that it is impracticable to
        raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation. Tax laws have in vain been multiplied;
        new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried; the public expectation has
        been uniformly disappointed, and the treasuries of the States have remained empty. The
        popular system of administration inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding
        with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated state of trade, has
        hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collections, and has at length taught the
        different legislatures the folly of attempting them.</p>
      <p>No person acquainted with what happens in other countries will be surprised at this
        circumstance. In so opulent a nation as that of Britain, where direct taxes from superior
        wealth must be much more tolerable, and, from the vigor of the government, much more
        practicable, than in America, far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from
        taxes of the indirect kind, from imposts, and from excises. Duties on imported articles form
        a large branch of this latter description.</p>
      <p>In America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly
        on such duties. In most parts of it, excises must be confined within a narrow compass. The
        genius of the people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws.
        The pockets of the farmers, on the other hand, will reluctantly yield but scanty supplies,
        in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses and lands; and personal property is
        too precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way than by the
        inperceptible agency of taxes on consumption.</p>
      <p>If these remarks have any foundation, that state of things which will best enable us to
        improve and extend so valuable a resource must be best adapted to our political welfare. And
        it cannot admit of a serious doubt, that this state of things must rest on the basis of a
        general Union. As far as this would be conducive to the interests of commerce, so far it
        must tend to the extension of the revenue to be drawn from that source. As far as it would
        contribute to rendering regulations for the collection of the duties more simple and
        efficacious, so far it must serve to answer the purposes of making the same rate of duties
        more productive, and of putting it into the power of the government to increase the rate
        without prejudice to trade.</p>
      <p>The relative situation of these States; the number of rivers with which they are
        intersected, and of bays that wash there shores; the facility of communication in every
        direction; the affinity of language and manners; the familiar habits of intercourse; --all
        these are circumstances that would conspire to render an illicit trade between them a matter
        of little difficulty, and would insure frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of
        each other. The separate States or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual jealousy to
        avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the lowness of their duties. The temper of
        our governments, for a long time to come, would not permit those rigorous precautions by
        which the European nations guard the avenues into their respective countries, as well by
        land as by water; and which, even there, are found insufficient obstacles to the adventurous
        stratagems of avarice.</p>
      <p>In France, there is an army of patrols (as they are called) constantly employed to secure
        their fiscal regulations against the inroads of the dealers in contraband trade. Mr. Neckar
        computes the number of these patrols at upwards of twenty thousand. This shows the immense
        difficulty in preventing that species of traffic, where there is an inland communication,
        and places in a strong light the disadvantages with which the collection of duties in this
        country would be encumbered, if by disunion the States should be placed in a situation, with
        respect to each other, resembling that of France with respect to her neighbors. The
        arbitrary and vexatious powers with which the patrols are necessarily armed, would be
        intolerable in a free country.</p>
      <p>If, on the contrary, there be but one government pervading all the States, there will be,
        as to the principal part of our commerce, but ONE SIDE to guard--the ATLANTIC COAST. Vessels
        arriving directly from foreign countries, laden with valuable cargoes, would rarely choose
        to hazard themselves to the complicated and critical perils which would attend attempts to
        unlade prior to their coming into port. They would have to dread both the dangers of the
        coast, and of detection, as well after as before their arrival at the places of their final
        destination. An ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the prevention of any
        material infractions upon the rights of the revenue. A few armed vessels, judiciously
        stationed at the entrances of our ports, might at a small expense be made useful sentinels
        of the laws. And the government having the same interest to provide against violations
        everywhere, the co-operation of its measures in each State would have a powerful tendency to
        render them effectual. Here also we should preserve by Union, an advantage which nature
        holds out to us, and which would be relinquished by separation. The United States lie at a
        great distance from Europe, and at a considerable distance from all other places with which
        they would have extensive connections of foreign trade. The passage from them to us, in a
        few hours, or in a single night, as between the coasts of France and Britain, and of other
        neighboring nations, would be impracticable. This is a prodigious security against a direct
        contraband with foreign countries; but a circuitous contraband to one State, through the
        medium of another, would be both easy and safe. The difference between a direct importation
        from abroad, and an indirect importation through the channel of a neighboring State, in
        small parcels, according to time and opportunity, with the additional facilities of inland
        communication, must be palpable to every man of discernment.</p>
      <p>It is therefore evident, that one national government would be able, at much less expense,
        to extend the duties on imports, beyond comparison, further than would be practicable to the
        States separately, or to any partial confederacies. Hitherto, I believe, it may safely be
        asserted, that these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any State three per cent.
        In France they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent., and in Britain they exceed this
        proportion.1 There seems to be nothing to hinder their being increased in this country to at
        least treble their present amount. The single article of ardent spirits, under federal
        regulation, might be made to furnish a considerable revenue. Upon a ratio to the importation
        into this State, the whole quantity imported into the United States may be estimated at four
        millions of gallons; which, at a shilling per gallon, would produce two hundred thousand
        pounds. That article would well bear this rate of duty; and if it should tend to diminish
        the consumption of it, such an effect would be equally favorable to the agriculture, to the
        economy, to the morals, and to the health of the society. There is, perhaps, nothing so much
        a subject of national extravagance as these spirits.</p>
      <p>What will be the consequence, if we are not able to avail ourselves of the resource in
        question in its full extent? A nation cannot long exist without revenues. Destitute of this
        essential support, it must resign its independence, and sink into the degraded condition of
        a province. This is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede. Revenue,
        therefore, must be had at all events. In this country, if the principal part be not drawn
        from commerce, it must fall with oppressive weight upon land. It has been already intimated
        that excises, in their true signification, are too little in unison with the feelings of the
        people, to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation; nor, indeed, in the
        States where almost the sole employment is agriculture, are the objects proper for excise
        sufficiently numerous to permit very ample collections in that way. Personal estate (as has
        been before remarked), from the difficulty in tracing it, cannot be subjected to large
        contributions, by any other means than by taxes on consumption. In populous cities, it may
        be enough the subject of conjecture, to occasion the oppression of individuals, without much
        aggregate benefit to the State; but beyond these circles, it must, in a great measure,
        escape the eye and the hand of the tax-gatherer. As the necessities of the State,
        nevertheless, must be satisfied in some mode or other, the defect of other resources must
        throw the principal weight of public burdens on the possessors of land. And as, on the other
        hand, the wants of the government can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the
        sources of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the community, under such
        embarrassments, cannot be put into a situation consistent with its respectability or its
        security. Thus we shall not even have the consolations of a full treasury, to atone for the
        oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed in the cultivation of the
        soil. But public and private distress will keep pace with each other in gloomy concert; and
        unite in deploring the infatuation of those counsels which led to disunion.</p>

    <p>Advantage of the Union in Respect to Economy in Government</p>
    <p>For the Independent Journal.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>As CONNECTED with the subject of revenue, we may with propriety consider that of economy.
        The money saved from one object may be usefully applied to another, and there will be so
        much the less to be drawn from the pockets of the people. If the States are united under one
        government, there will be but one national civil list to support; if they are divided into
        several confederacies, there will be as many different national civil lists to be provided
        for--and each of them, as to the principal departments, coextensive with that which would be
        necessary for a government of the whole. The entire separation of the States into thirteen
        unconnected sovereignties is a project too extravagant and too replete with danger to have
        many advocates. The ideas of men who speculate upon the dismemberment of the empire seem
        generally turned toward three confederacies--one consisting of the four Northern, another of
        the four Middle, and a third of the five Southern States. There is little probability that
        there would be a greater number. According to this distribution, each confederacy would
        comprise an extent of territory larger than that of the kingdom of Great Britain. No
        well-informed man will suppose that the affairs of such a confederacy can be properly
        regulated by a government less comprehensive in its organs or institutions than that which
        has been proposed by the convention. When the dimensions of a State attain to a certain
        magnitude, it requires the same energy of government and the same forms of administration
        which are requisite in one of much greater extent. This idea admits not of precise
        demonstration, because there is no rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power
        necessary to the government of any given number of individuals; but when we consider that
        the island of Britain, nearly commensurate with each of the supposed confederacies, contains
        about eight millions of people, and when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to
        direct the passions of so large a society to the public good, we shall see no reason to
        doubt that the like portion of power would be sufficient to perform the same task in a
        society far more numerous. Civil power, properly organized and exerted, is capable of
        diffusing its force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce itself in every
        part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate institutions.</p>
      <p>The supposition that each confederacy into which the States would be likely to be divided
        would require a government not less comprehensive than the one proposed, will be
        strengthened by another supposition, more probable than that which presents us with three
        confederacies as the alternative to a general Union. If we attend carefully to geographical
        and commercial considerations, in conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the
        different States, we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they will most
        naturally league themselves under two governments. The four Eastern States, from all the
        causes that form the links of national sympathy and connection, may with certainty be
        expected to unite. New York, situated as she is, would never be unwise enough to oppose a
        feeble and unsupported flank to the weight of that confederacy. There are other obvious
        reasons that would facilitate her accession to it. New Jersey is too small a State to think
        of being a frontier, in opposition to this still more powerful combination; nor do there
        appear to be any obstacles to her admission into it. Even Pennsylvania would have strong
        inducements to join the Northern league. An active foreign commerce, on the basis of her own
        navigation, is her true policy, and coincides with the opinions and dispositions of her
        citizens. The more Southern States, from various circumstances, may not think themselves
        much interested in the encouragement of navigation. They may prefer a system which would
        give unlimited scope to all nations to be the carriers as well as the purchasers of their
        commodities. Pennsylvania may not choose to confound her interests in a connection so
        adverse to her policy. As she must at all events be a frontier, she may deem it most
        consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned towards the weaker power of the
        Southern, rather than towards the stronger power of the Northern, Confederacy. This would
        give her the fairest chance to avoid being the Flanders of America. Whatever may be the
        determination of Pennsylvania, if the Northern Confederacy includes New Jersey, there is no
        likelihood of more than one confederacy to the south of that State.</p>
      <p>Nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen States will be able to support a
        national government better than one half, or one third, or any number less than the whole.
        This reflection must have great weight in obviating that objection to the proposed plan,
        which is founded on the principle of expense; an objection, however, which, when we come to
        take a nearer view of it, will appear in every light to stand on mistaken ground.</p>
      <p>If, in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil lists, we take into view the
        number of persons who must necessarily be employed to guard the inland communication between
        the different confederacies against illicit trade, and who in time will infallibly spring up
        out of the necessities of revenue; and if we also take into view the military establishments
        which it has been shown would unavoidably result from the jealousies and conflicts of the
        several nations into which the States would be divided, we shall clearly discover that a
        separation would be not less injurious to the economy, than to the tranquillity, commerce,
        revenue, and liberty of every part.</p>

    <p>The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union</p>
    <p>For the Independent Journal.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York.</p>
      <p>IN THE course of the preceding papers, I have endeavored, my fellow-citizens, to place
        before you, in a clear and convincing light, the importance of Union to your political
        safety and happiness. I have unfolded to you a complication of dangers to which you would be
        exposed, should you permit that sacred knot which binds the people of America together be
        severed or dissolved by ambition or by avarice, by jealousy or by misrepresentation. In the
        sequel of the inquiry through which I propose to accompany you, the truths intended to be
        inculcated will receive further confirmation from facts and arguments hitherto unnoticed. If
        the road over which you will still have to pass should in some places appear to you tedious
        or irksome, you will recollect that you are in quest of information on a subject the most
        momentous which can engage the attention of a free people, that the field through which you
        have to travel is in itself spacious, and that the difficulties of the journey have been
        unnecessarily increased by the mazes with which sophistry has beset the way. It will be my
        aim to remove the obstacles from your progress in as compendious a manner as it can be done,
        without sacrificing utility to despatch.</p>
      <p>In pursuance of the plan which I have laid down for the discussion of the subject, the
        point next in order to be examined is the "insufficiency of the present Confederation to the
        preservation of the Union." It may perhaps be asked what need there is of reasoning or proof
        to illustrate a position which is not either controverted or doubted, to which the
        understandings and feelings of all classes of men assent, and which in substance is admitted
        by the opponents as well as by the friends of the new Constitution. It must in truth be
        acknowledged that, however these may differ in other respects, they in general appear to
        harmonize in this sentiment, at least, that there are material imperfections in our national
        system, and that something is necessary to be done to rescue us from impending anarchy. The
        facts that support this opinion are no longer objects of speculation. They have forced
        themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large, and have at length extorted from
        those, whose mistaken policy has had the principal share in precipitating the extremity at
        which we are arrived, a reluctant confession of the reality of those defects in the scheme
        of our federal government, which have been long pointed out and regretted by the intelligent
        friends of the Union.</p>
      <p>We may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of national
        humiliation. There is scarcely anything that can wound the pride or degrade the character of
        an independent nation which we do not experience. Are there engagements to the performance
        of which we are held by every tie respectable among men? These are the subjects of constant
        and unblushing violation. Do we owe debts to foreigners and to our own citizens contracted
        in a time of imminent peril for the preservation of our political existence? These remain
        without any proper or satisfactory provision for their discharge. Have we valuable
        territories and important posts in the possession of a foreign power which, by express
        stipulations, ought long since to have been surrendered? These are still retained, to the
        prejudice of our interests, not less than of our rights. Are we in a condition to resent or
        to repel the aggression? We have neither troops, nor treasury, nor government.1 Are we even
        in a condition to remonstrate with dignity? The just imputations on our own faith, in
        respect to the same treaty, ought first to be removed. Are we entitled by nature and compact
        to a free participation in the navigation of the Mississippi? Spain excludes us from it. Is
        public credit an indispensable resource in time of public danger? We seem to have abandoned
        its cause as desperate and irretrievable. Is commerce of importance to national wealth? Ours
        is at the lowest point of declension. Is respectability in the eyes of foreign powers a
        safeguard against foreign encroachments? The imbecility of our government even forbids them
        to treat with us. Our ambassadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic sovereignty. Is a
        violent and unnatural decrease in the value of land a symptom of national distress? The
        price of improved land in most parts of the country is much lower than can be accounted for
        by the quantity of waste land at market, and can only be fully explained by that want of
        private and public confidence, which are so alarmingly prevalent among all ranks, and which
        have a direct tendency to depreciate property of every kind. Is private credit the friend
        and patron of industry? That most useful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is
        reduced within the narrowest limits, and this still more from an opinion of insecurity than
        from the scarcity of money. To shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford
        neither pleasure nor instruction, it may in general be demanded, what indication is there of
        national disorder, poverty, and insignificance that could befall a community so peculiarly
        blessed with natural advantages as we are, which does not form a part of the dark catalogue
        of our public misfortunes?</p>
      <p>This is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought by those very maxims and
        councils which would now deter us from adopting the proposed Constitution; and which, not
        content with having conducted us to the brink of a precipice, seem resolved to plunge us
        into the abyss that awaits us below. Here, my countrymen, impelled by every motive that
        ought to influence an enlightened people, let us make a firm stand for our safety, our
        tranquillity, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at last break the fatal charm which has
        too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and prosperity.</p>
      <p>It is true, as has been before observed that facts, too stubborn to be resisted, have
        produced a species of general assent to the abstract proposition that there exist material
        defects in our national system; but the usefulness of the concession, on the part of the old
        adversaries of federal measures, is destroyed by a strenuous opposition to a remedy, upon
        the only principles that can give it a chance of success. While they admit that the
        government of the United States is destitute of energy, they contend against conferring upon
        it those powers which are requisite to supply that energy. They seem still to aim at things
        repugnant and irreconcilable; at an augmentation of federal authority, without a diminution
        of State authority; at sovereignty in the Union, and complete independence in the members.
        They still, in fine, seem to cherish with blind devotion the political monster of an
        imperium in imperio. This renders a full display of the principal defects of the
        Confederation necessary, in order to show that the evils we experience do not proceed from
        minute or partial imperfections, but from fundamental errors in the structure of the
        building, which cannot be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first principles
        and main pillars of the fabric.</p>
      <p>The great and radical vice in the construction of the existing Confederation is in the
        principle of LEGISLATION for STATES or GOVERNMENTS, in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE
        CAPACITIES, and as contradistinguished from the INDIVIDUALS of which they consist. Though
        this principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the Union, yet it pervades
        and governs those on which the efficacy of the rest depends. Except as to the rule of
        appointment, the United States has an indefinite discretion to make requisitions for men and
        money; but they have no authority to raise either, by regulations extending to the
        individual citizens of America. The consequence of this is, that though in theory their
        resolutions concerning those objects are laws, constitutionally binding on the members of
        the Union, yet in practice they are mere recommendations which the States observe or
        disregard at their option.</p>
      <p>It is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human mind, that after all the
        admonitions we have had from experience on this head, there should still be found men who
        object to the new Constitution, for deviating from a principle which has been found the bane
        of the old, and which is in itself evidently incompatible with the idea of GOVERNMENT; a
        principle, in short, which, if it is to be executed at all, must substitute the violent and
        sanguinary agency of the sword to the mild influence of the magistracy.</p>
      <p>There is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league or alliance between
        independent nations for certain defined purposes precisely stated in a treaty regulating all
        the details of time, place, circumstance, and quantity; leaving nothing to future
        discretion; and depending for its execution on the good faith of the parties. Compacts of
        this kind exist among all civilized nations, subject to the usual vicissitudes of peace and
        war, of observance and non-observance, as the interests or passions of the contracting
        powers dictate. In the early part of the present century there was an epidemical rage in
        Europe for this species of compacts, from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped
        for benefits which were never realized. With a view to establishing the equilibrium of power
        and the peace of that part of the world, all the resources of negotiation were exhausted,
        and triple and quadruple alliances were formed; but they were scarcely formed before they
        were broken, giving an instructive but afflicting lesson to mankind, how little dependence
        is to be placed on treaties which have no other sanction than the obligations of good faith,
        and which oppose general considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of any immediate
        interest or passion.</p>
      <p>If the particular States in this country are disposed to stand in a similar relation to
        each other, and to drop the project of a general DISCRETIONARY SUPERINTENDENCE, the scheme
        would indeed be pernicious, and would entail upon us all the mischiefs which have been
        enumerated under the first head; but it would have the merit of being, at least, consistent
        and practicable Abandoning all views towards a confederate government, this would bring us
        to a simple alliance offensive and defensive; and would place us in a situation to be
        alternate friends and enemies of each other, as our mutual jealousies and rivalships,
        nourished by the intrigues of foreign nations, should prescribe to us.</p>
      <p>But if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation; if we still will adhere to
        the design of a national government, or, which is the same thing, of a superintending power,
        under the direction of a common council, we must resolve to incorporate into our plan those
        ingredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic difference between a
        league and a government; we must extend the authority of the Union to the persons of the
        citizens, --the only proper objects of government.</p>
      <p>Government implies the power of making laws. It is essential to the idea of a law, that it
        be attended with a sanction; or, in other words, a penalty or punishment for disobedience.
        If there be no penalty annexed to disobedience, the resolutions or commands which pretend to
        be laws will, in fact, amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation. This penalty,
        whatever it may be, can only be inflicted in two ways: by the agency of the courts and
        ministers of justice, or by military force; by the COERCION of the magistracy, or by the
        COERCION of arms. The first kind can evidently apply only to men; the last kind must of
        necessity, be employed against bodies politic, or communities, or States. It is evident that
        there is no process of a court by which the observance of the laws can, in the last resort,
        be enforced. Sentences may be denounced against them for violations of their duty; but these
        sentences can only be carried into execution by the sword. In an association where the
        general authority is confined to the collective bodies of the communities, that compose it,
        every breach of the laws must involve a state of war; and military execution must become the
        only instrument of civil obedience. Such a state of things can certainly not deserve the
        name of government, nor would any prudent man choose to commit his happiness to it.</p>
      <p>There was a time when we were told that breaches, by the States, of the regulations of the
        federal authority were not to be expected; that a sense of common interest would preside
        over the conduct of the respective members, and would beget a full compliance with all the
        constitutional requisitions of the Union. This language, at the present day, would appear as
        wild as a great part of what we now hear from the same quarter will be thought, when we
        shall have received further lessons from that best oracle of wisdom, experience. It at all
        times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is actuated, and
        belied the original inducements to the establishment of civil power. Why has government been
        instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason
        and justice, without constraint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more
        rectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals? The contrary of this has been
        inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind; and the inference is founded
        upon obvious reasons. Regard to reputation has a less active influence, when the infamy of a
        bad action is to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon one. A spirit
        of faction, which is apt to mingle its poison in the deliberations of all bodies of men,
        will often hurry the persons of whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses, for
        which they would blush in a private capacity.</p>
      <p>In addition to all this, there is, in the nature of sovereign power, an impatience of
        control, that disposes those who are invested with the exercise of it, to look with an evil
        eye upon all external attempts to restrain or direct its operations. From this spirit it
        happens, that in every political association which is formed upon the principle of uniting
        in a common interest a number of lesser sovereignties, there will be found a kind of
        eccentric tendency in the subordinate or inferior orbs, by the operation of which there will
        be a perpetual effort in each to fly off from the common centre. This tendency is not
        difficult to be accounted for. It has its origin in the love of power. Power controlled or
        abridged is almost always the rival and enemy of that power by which it is controlled or
        abridged. This simple proposition will teach us how little reason there is to expect, that
        the persons intrusted with the administration of the affairs of the particular members of a
        confederacy will at all times be ready, with perfect good-humor, and an unbiased regard to
        the public weal, to execute the resolutions or decrees of the general authority. The reverse
        of this results from the constitution of human nature.</p>
      <p>If, therefore, the measures of the Confederacy cannot be executed without the intervention
        of the particular administrations, there will be little prospect of their being executed at
        all. The rulers of the respective members, whether they have a constitutional right to do it
        or not, will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures themselves. They will
        consider the conformity of the thing proposed or required to their immediate interests or
        aims; the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption. All this
        will be done; and in a spirit of interested and suspicious scrutiny, without that knowledge
        of national circumstances and reasons of state, which is essential to a right judgment, and
        with that strong predilection in favor of local objects, which can hardly fail to mislead
        the decision. The same process must be repeated in every member of which the body is
        constituted; and the execution of the plans, framed by the councils of the whole, will
        always fluctuate on the discretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part.
        Those who have been conversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies; who have seen how
        difficult it often is, where there is no exterior pressure of circumstances, to bring them
        to harmonious resolutions on important points, will readily conceive how impossible it must
        be to induce a number of such assemblies, deliberating at a distance from each other, at
        different times, and under different impressions, long to co-operate in the same views and
        pursuits.</p>
      <p>In our case, the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign wills is requisite, under the
        Confederation, to the complete execution of every important measure that proceeds from the
        Union. It has happened as was to have been foreseen. The measures of the Union have not been
        executed; the delinquencies of the States have, step by step, matured themselves to an
        extreme, which has, at length, arrested all the wheels of the national government, and
        brought them to an awful stand. Congress at this time scarcely possess the means of keeping
        up the forms of administration, till the States can have time to agree upon a more
        substantial substitute for the present shadow of a federal government. Things did not come
        to this desperate extremity at once. The causes which have been specified produced at first
        only unequal and disproportionate degrees of compliance with the requisitions of the Union.
        The greater deficiencies of some States furnished the pretext of example and the temptation
        of interest to the complying, or to the least delinquent States. Why should we do more in
        proportion than those who are embarked with us in the same political voyage? Why should we
        consent to bear more than our proper share of the common burden? These were suggestions
        which human selfishness could not withstand, and which even speculative men, who looked
        forward to remote consequences, could not, without hesitation, combat. Each State, yielding
        to the persuasive voice of immediate interest or convenience, has successively withdrawn its
        support, till the frail and tottering edifice seems ready to fall upon our heads, and to
        crush us beneath its ruins.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 24</title>
    <p>The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered</p>
    <p>For the Independent Journal.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>To THE powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal government, in respect to the
        creation and direction of the national forces, I have met with but one specific objection,
        which, if I understand it right, is this, that proper provision has not been made against
        the existence of standing armies in time of peace; an objection which, I shall now endeavor
        to show, rests on weak and unsubstantial foundations.</p>
      <p>It has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general form, supported only by
        bold assertions, without the appearance of argument; without even the sanction of
        theoretical opinions; in contradiction to the practice of other free nations, and to the
        general sense of America, as expressed in most of the existing constitutions. The
        proprietory of this remark will appear, the moment it is recollected that the objection
        under consideration turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the LEGISLATIVE authority
        of the nation, in the article of military establishments; a principle unheard of, except in
        one or two of our State constitutions, and rejected in all the rest.</p>
      <p>A stranger to our politics, who was to read our newspapers at the present juncture, without
        having previously inspected the plan reported by the convention, would be naturally led to
        one of two conclusions: either that it contained a positive injunction, that standing armies
        should be kept up in time of peace; or that it vested in the EXECUTIVE the whole power of
        levying troops, without subjecting his discretion, in any shape, to the control of the
        legislature.</p>
      <p>If he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself, he would be surprised to discover, that
        neither the one nor the other was the case; that the whole power of raising armies was
        lodged in the LEGISLATURE, not in the EXECUTIVE; that this legislature was to be a popular
        body, consisting of the representatives of the people periodically elected; and that instead
        of the provision he had supposed in favor of standing armies, there was to be found, in
        respect to this object, an important qualification even of the legislative discretion, in
        that clause which forbids the appropriation of money for the support of an army for any
        longer period than two years a precaution which, upon a nearer view of it, will appear to be
        a great and real security against the keeping up of troops without evident necessity.</p>
      <p>Disappointed in his first surmise, the person I have supposed would be apt to pursue his
        conjectures a little further. He would naturally say to himself, it is impossible that all
        this vehement and pathetic declamation can be without some colorable pretext. It must needs
        be that this people, so jealous of their liberties, have, in all the preceding models of the
        constitutions which they have established, inserted the most precise and rigid precautions
        on this point, the omission of which, in the new plan, has given birth to all this
        apprehension and clamor.</p>
      <p>If, under this impression, he proceeded to pass in review the several State constitutions,
        how great would be his disappointment to find that TWO ONLY of them [1] contained an
        interdiction of standing armies in time of peace; that the other eleven had either observed
        a profound silence on the subject, or had in express terms admitted the right of the
        Legislature to authorize their existence.</p>
      <p>Still, however he would be persuaded that there must be some plausible foundation for the
        cry raised on this head. He would never be able to imagine, while any source of information
        remained unexplored, that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the public credulity,
        dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive, or by the overflowings of a zeal too
        intemperate to be ingenuous. It would probably occur to him, that he would be likely to find
        the precautions he was in search of in the primitive compact between the States. Here, at
        length, he would expect to meet with a solution of the enigma. No doubt, he would observe to
        himself, the existing Confederation must contain the most explicit provisions against
        military establishments in time of peace; and a departure from this model, in a favorite
        point, has occasioned the discontent which appears to influence these political
        champions.</p>
      <p>If he should now apply himself to a careful and critical survey of the articles of
        Confederation, his astonishment would not only be increased, but would acquire a mixture of
        indignation, at the unexpected discovery, that these articles, instead of containing the
        prohibition he looked for, and though they had, with jealous circumspection, restricted the
        authority of the State legislatures in this particular, had not imposed a single restraint
        on that of the United States. If he happened to be a man of quick sensibility, or ardent
        temper, he could now no longer refrain from regarding these clamors as the dishonest
        artifices of a sinister and unprincipled opposition to a plan which ought at least to
        receive a fair and candid examination from all sincere lovers of their country! How else, he
        would say, could the authors of them have been tempted to vent such loud censures upon that
        plan, about a point in which it seems to have conformed itself to the general sense of
        America as declared in its different forms of government, and in which it has even
        superadded a new and powerful guard unknown to any of them? If, on the contrary, he happened
        to be a man of calm and dispassionate feelings, he would indulge a sigh for the frailty of
        human nature, and would lament, that in a matter so interesting to the happiness of
        millions, the true merits of the question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients so
        unfriendly to an impartial and right determination. Even such a man could hardly forbear
        remarking, that a conduct of this kind has too much the appearance of an intention to
        mislead the people by alarming their passions, rather than to convince them by arguments
        addressed to their understandings.</p>
      <p>But however little this objection may be countenanced, even by precedents among ourselves,
        it may be satisfactory to take a nearer view of its intrinsic merits. From a close
        examination it will appear that restraints upon the discretion of the legislature in respect
        to military establishments in time of peace, would be improper to be imposed, and if
        imposed, from the necessities of society, would be unlikely to be observed.</p>
      <p>Though a wide ocean separates the United States from Europe, yet there are various
        considerations that warn us against an excess of confidence or security. On one side of us,
        and stretching far into our rear, are growing settlements subject to the dominion of
        Britain. On the other side, and extending to meet the British settlements, are colonies and
        establishments subject to the dominion of Spain. This situation and the vicinity of the West
        India Islands, belonging to these two powers create between them, in respect to their
        American possessions and in relation to us, a common interest. The savage tribes on our
        Western frontier ought to be regarded as our natural enemies, their natural allies, because
        they have most to fear from us, and most to hope from them. The improvements in the art of
        navigation have, as to the facility of communication, rendered distant nations, in a great
        measure, neighbors. Britain and Spain are among the principal maritime powers of Europe. A
        future concert of views between these nations ought not to be regarded as improbable. The
        increasing remoteness of consanguinity is every day diminishing the force of the family
        compact between France and Spain. And politicians have ever with great reason considered the
        ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of political connection. These circumstances
        combined, admonish us not to be too sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the
        reach of danger.</p>
      <p>Previous to the Revolution, and ever since the peace, there has been a constant necessity
        for keeping small garrisons on our Western frontier. No person can doubt that these will
        continue to be indispensable, if it should only be against the ravages and depredations of
        the Indians. These garrisons must either be furnished by occasional detachments from the
        militia, or by permanent corps in the pay of the government. The first is impracticable; and
        if practicable, would be pernicious. The militia would not long, if at all, submit to be
        dragged from their occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in times
        of profound peace. And if they could be prevailed upon or compelled to do it, the increased
        expense of a frequent rotation of service, and the loss of labor and disconcertion of the
        industrious pursuits of individuals, would form conclusive objections to the scheme. It
        would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as ruinous to private citizens. The
        latter resource of permanent corps in the pay of the government amounts to a standing army
        in time of peace; a small one, indeed, but not the less real for being small. Here is a
        simple view of the subject, that shows us at once the impropriety of a constitutional
        interdiction of such establishments, and the necessity of leaving the matter to the
        discretion and prudence of the legislature.</p>
      <p>In proportion to our increase in strength, it is probable, nay, it may be said certain,
        that Britain and Spain would augment their military establishments in our neighborhood. If
        we should not be willing to be exposed, in a naked and defenseless condition, to their
        insults and encroachments, we should find it expedient to increase our frontier garrisons in
        some ratio to the force by which our Western settlements might be annoyed. There are, and
        will be, particular posts, the possession of which will include the command of large
        districts of territory, and facilitate future invasions of the remainder. It may be added
        that some of those posts will be keys to the trade with the Indian nations. Can any man
        think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one
        or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers? To act this part would be to desert
        all the usual maxims of prudence and policy.</p>
      <p>If we mean to be a commercial people, or even to be secure on our Atlantic side, we must
        endeavor, as soon as possible, to have a navy. To this purpose there must be dock-yards and
        arsenals; and for the defense of these, fortifications, and probably garrisons. When a
        nation has become so powerful by sea that it can protect its dock-yards by its fleets, this
        supersedes the necessity of garrisons for that purpose; but where naval establishments are
        in their infancy, moderate garrisons will, in all likelihood, be found an indispensable
        security against descents for the destruction of the arsenals and dock-yards, and sometimes
        of the fleet itself.</p>
      <p>PUBLIUS.</p>
      <p>1 This statement of the matter is taken from the printed collection of State constitutions.
        Pennsylvania and North Carolina are the two which contain the interdiction in these words:
        "As standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, THEY OUGHT NOT to be kept
        up." This is, in truth, rather a CAUTION than a PROHIBITION. New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
        Delaware, and Maryland have, in each of their bils of rights, a clause to this effect:
        "Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up WITHOUT THE
        CONSENT OF THE LEGISLATURE"; which is a formal admission of the authority of the
        Legislature. New York has no bills of rights, and her constitution says not a word about the
        matter. No bills of rights appear annexed to the constitutions of the other States, except
        the foregoing, and their constitutions are equally silent. I am told, however that one or
        two States have bills of rights which do not appear in this collection; but that those also
        recognize the right of the legislative authority in this respect.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 26</title>
    <p>The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the Common Defense
      Considered</p>
    <p>For the Independent Journal.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>IT WAS a thing hardly to be expected that in a popular revolution the minds of men should
        stop at that happy mean which marks the salutary boundary between POWER and PRIVILEGE, and
        combines the energy of government with the security of private rights. A failure in this
        delicate and important point is the great source of the inconveniences we experience, and if
        we are not cautious to avoid a repetition of the error, in our future attempts to rectify
        and ameliorate our system, we may travel from one chimerical project to another; we may try
        change after change; but we shall never be likely to make any material change for the
        better.</p>
      <p>The idea of restraining the legislative authority, in the means of providing for the
        national defense, is one of those refinements which owe their origin to a zeal for liberty
        more ardent than enlightened. We have seen, however, that it has not had thus far an
        extensive prevalency; that even in this country, where it made its first appearance,
        Pennsylvania and North Carolina are the only two States by which it has been in any degree
        patronized; and that all the others have refused to give it the least countenance; wisely
        judging that confidence must be placed somewhere; that the necessity of doing it, is implied
        in the very act of delegating power; and that it is better to hazard the abuse of that
        confidence than to embarrass the government and endanger the public safety by impolitic
        restrictions on the legislative authority. The opponents of the proposed Constitution
        combat, in this respect, the general decision of America; and instead of being taught by
        experience the propriety of correcting any extremes into which we may have heretofore run,
        they appear disposed to conduct us into others still more dangerous, and more extravagant.
        As if the tone of government had been found too high, or too rigid, the doctrines they teach
        are calculated to induce us to depress or to relax it, by expedients which, upon other
        occasions, have been condemned or forborne. It may be affirmed without the imputation of
        invective, that if the principles they inculcate, on various points, could so far obtain as
        to become the popular creed, they would utterly unfit the people of this country for any
        species of government whatever. But a danger of this kind is not to be apprehended. The
        citizens of America have too much discernment to be argued into anarchy. And I am much
        mistaken, if experience has not wrought a deep and solemn conviction in the public mind,
        that greater energy of government is essential to the welfare and prosperity of the
        community.</p>
      <p>It may not be amiss in this place concisely to remark the origin and progress of the idea,
        which aims at the exclusion of military establishments in time of peace. Though in
        speculative minds it may arise from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of such
        institutions, fortified by the events that have happened in other ages and countries, yet as
        a national sentiment, it must be traced to those habits of thinking which we derive from the
        nation from whom the inhabitants of these States have in general sprung.</p>
      <p>In England, for a long time after the Norman Conquest, the authority of the monarch was
        almost unlimited. Inroads were gradually made upon the prerogative, in favor of liberty,
        first by the barons, and afterwards by the people, till the greatest part of its most
        formidable pretensions became extinct. But it was not till the revolution in 1688, which
        elevated the Prince of Orange to the throne of Great Britain, that English liberty was
        completely triumphant. As incident to the undefined power of making war, an acknowledged
        prerogative of the crown, Charles II. had, by his own authority, kept on foot in time of
        peace a body of 5,000 regular troops. And this number James II. increased to 30,000; who
        were paid out of his civil list. At the revolution, to abolish the exercise of so dangerous
        an authority, it became an article of the Bill of Rights then framed, that "the raising or
        keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, UNLESS WITH THE CONSENT OF
        PARLIAMENT, was against law."</p>
      <p>In that kingdom, when the pulse of liberty was at its highest pitch, no security against
        the danger of standing armies was thought requisite, beyond a prohibition of their being
        raised or kept up by the mere authority of the executive magistrate. The patriots, who
        effected that memorable revolution, were too temperate, too wellinformed, to think of any
        restraint on the legislative discretion. They were aware that a certain number of troops for
        guards and garrisons were indispensable; that no precise bounds could be set to the national
        exigencies; that a power equal to every possible contingency must exist somewhere in the
        government: and that when they referred the exercise of that power to the judgment of the
        legislature, they had arrived at the ultimate point of precaution which was reconcilable
        with the safety of the community.</p>
      <p>From the same source, the people of America may be said to have derived an hereditary
        impression of danger to liberty, from standing armies in time of peace. The circumstances of
        a revolution quickened the public sensibility on every point connected with the security of
        popular rights, and in some instances raise the warmth of our zeal beyond the degree which
        consisted with the due temperature of the body politic. The attempts of two of the States to
        restrict the authority of the legislature in the article of military establishments, are of
        the number of these instances. The principles which had taught us to be jealous of the power
        of an hereditary monarch were by an injudicious excess extended to the representatives of
        the people in their popular assemblies. Even in some of the States, where this error was not
        adopted, we find unnecessary declarations that standing armies ought not to be kept up, in
        time of peace, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. I call them unnecessary, because the
        reason which had introduced a similar provision into the English Bill of Rights is not
        applicable to any of the State constitutions. The power of raising armies at all, under
        those constitutions, can by no construction be deemed to reside anywhere else, than in the
        legislatures themselves; and it was superfluous, if not absurd, to declare that a matter
        should not be done without the consent of a body, which alone had the power of doing it.
        Accordingly, in some of these constitutions, and among others, in that of this State of New
        York, which has been justly celebrated, both in Europe and America, as one of the best of
        the forms of government established in this country, there is a total silence upon the
        subject.</p>
      <p>It is remarkable, that even in the two States which seem to have meditated an interdiction
        of military establishments in time of peace, the mode of expression made use of is rather
        cautionary than prohibitory. It is not said, that standing armies SHALL NOT BE kept up, but
        that they OUGHT NOT to be kept up, in time of peace. This ambiguity of terms appears to have
        been the result of a conflict between jealousy and conviction; between the desire of
        excluding such establishments at all events, and the persuasion that an absolute exclusion
        would be unwise and unsafe.</p>
      <p>Can it be doubted that such a provision, whenever the situation of public affairs was
        understood to require a departure from it, would be interpreted by the legislature into a
        mere admonition, and would be made to yield to the necessities or supposed necessities of
        the State? Let the fact already mentioned, with respect to Pennsylvania, decide. What then
        (it may be asked) is the use of such a provision, if it cease to operate the moment there is
        an inclination to disregard it?</p>
      <p>Let us examine whether there be any comparison, in point of efficacy, between the provision
        alluded to and that which is contained in the new Constitution, for restraining the
        appropriations of money for military purposes to the period of two years. The former, by
        aiming at too much, is calculated to effect nothing; the latter, by steering clear of an
        imprudent extreme, and by being perfectly compatible with a proper provision for the
        exigencies of the nation, will have a salutary and powerful operation.</p>
      <p>The legislature of the United States will be OBLIGED, by this provision, once at least in
        every two years, to deliberate upon the propriety of keeping a military force on foot; to
        come to a new resolution on the point; and to declare their sense of the matter, by a formal
        vote in the face of their constituents. They are not AT LIBERTY to vest in the executive
        department permanent funds for the support of an army, if they were even incautious enough
        to be willing to repose in it so improper a confidence. As the spirit of party, in different
        degrees, must be expected to infect all political bodies, there will be, no doubt, persons
        in the national legislature willing enough to arraign the measures and criminate the views
        of the majority. The provision for the support of a military force will always be a
        favorable topic for declamation. As often as the question comes forward, the public
        attention will be roused and attracted to the subject, by the party in opposition; and if
        the majority should be really disposed to exceed the proper limits, the community will be
        warned of the danger, and will have an opportunity of taking measures to guard against it.
        Independent of parties in the national legislature itself, as often as the period of
        discussion arrived, the State legislatures, who will always be not only vigilant but
        suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments from
        the federal government, will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the
        national rulers, and will be ready enough, if any thing improper appears, to sound the alarm
        to the people, and not only to be the VOICE, but, if necessary, the ARM of their
        discontent.</p>
      <p>Schemes to subvert the liberties of a great community REQUIRE TIME to mature them for
        execution. An army, so large as seriously to menace those liberties, could only be formed by
        progressive augmentations; which would suppose, not merely a temporary combination between
        the legislature and executive, but a continued conspiracy for a series of time. Is it
        probable that such a combination would exist at all? Is it probable that it would be
        persevered in, and transmitted along through all the successive variations in a
        representative body, which biennial elections would naturally produce in both houses? Is it
        presumable, that every man, the instant he took his seat in the national Senate or House of
        Representatives, would commence a traitor to his constituents and to his country? Can it be
        supposed that there would not be found one man, discerning enough to detect so atrocious a
        conspiracy, or bold or honest enough to apprise his constituents of their danger? If such
        presumptions can fairly be made, there ought at once to be an end of all delegated
        authority. The people should resolve to recall all the powers they have heretofore parted
        with out of their own hands, and to divide themselves into as many States as there are
        counties, in order that they may be able to manage their own concerns in person.</p>
      <p>If such suppositions could even be reasonably made, still the concealment of the design,
        for any duration, would be impracticable. It would be announced, by the very circumstance of
        augmenting the army to so great an extent in time of profound peace. What colorable reason
        could be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast augmentations of the military
        force? It is impossible that the people could be long deceived; and the destruction of the
        project, and of the projectors, would quickly follow the discovery.</p>
      <p>It has been said that the provision which limits the appropriation of money for the support
        of an army to the period of two years would be unavailing, because the Executive, when once
        possessed of a force large enough to awe the people into submission, would find resources in
        that very force sufficient to enable him to dispense with supplies from the acts of the
        legislature. But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession
        of a force of that magnitude in time of peace? If we suppose it to have been created in
        consequence of some domestic insurrection or foreign war, then it becomes a case not within
        the principles of the objection; for this is levelled against the power of keeping up troops
        in time of peace. Few persons will be so visionary as seriously to contend that military
        forces ought not to be raised to quell a rebellion or resist an invasion; and if the defense
        of the community under such circumstances should make it necessary to have an army so
        numerous as to hazard its liberty, this is one of those calamaties for which there is
        neither preventative nor cure. It cannot be provided against by any possible form of
        government; it might even result from a simple league offensive and defensive, if it should
        ever be necessary for the confederates or allies to form an army for common defense.</p>
      <p>But it is an evil infinitely less likely to attend us in a united than in a disunited
        state; nay, it may be safely asserted that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in
        the latter situation. It is not easy to conceive a possibility that dangers so formidable
        can assail the whole Union, as to demand a force considerable enough to place our liberties
        in the least jeopardy, especially if we take into our view the aid to be derived from the
        militia, which ought always to be counted upon as a valuable and powerful auxiliary. But in
        a state of disunion (as has been fully shown in another place), the contrary of this
        supposition would become not only probable, but almost unavoidable.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 29</title>
    <p>Concerning the Militia</p>
    <p>From the Daily Advertiser.</p>
    <p>Thursday, January 10, 1788</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its services in times of
        insurrection and invasion are natural incidents to the duties of superintending the common
        defense, and of watching over the internal peace of the Confederacy.</p>
      <p>It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization
        and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever
        they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the
        duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of
        peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire
        the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their
        usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation
        of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most
        evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union "to provide
        for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as
        may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY
        THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE
        DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS."</p>
      <p>Of the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to the plan of the convention,
        there is none that was so little to have been expected, or is so untenable in itself, as the
        one from which this particular provision has been attacked. If a well-regulated militia be
        the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation
        and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the national security.
        If standing armies are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the
        body to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as far as possible, to
        take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions. If the federal
        government can command the aid of the militia in those emergencies which call for the
        military arm in support of the civil magistrate, it can the better dispense with the
        employment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail itself of the former, it will be
        obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army unnecessary, will be a more certain method
        of preventing its existence than a thousand prohibitions upon paper.</p>
      <p>In order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia to execute the laws
        of the Union, it has been remarked that there is nowhere any provision in the proposed
        Constitution for calling out the POSSE COMITATUS, to assist the magistrate in the execution
        of his duty, whence it has been inferred, that military force was intended to be his only
        auxiliary. There is a striking incoherence in the objections which have appeared, and
        sometimes even from the same quarter, not much calculated to inspire a very favorable
        opinion of the sincerity or fair dealing of their authors. The same persons who tell us in
        one breath, that the powers of the federal government will be despotic and unlimited, inform
        us in the next, that it has not authority sufficient even to call out the POSSE COMITATUS.
        The latter, fortunately, is as much short of the truth as the former exceeds it. It would be
        as absurd to doubt, that a right to pass all laws NECESSARY AND PROPER to execute its
        declared powers, would include that of requiring the assistance of the citizens to the
        officers who may be intrusted with the execution of those laws, as it would be to believe,
        that a right to enact laws necessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes
        would involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the alienation of landed property,
        or of abolishing the trial by jury in cases relating to it. It being therefore evident that
        the supposition of a want of power to require the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS is entirely
        destitute of color, it will follow, that the conclusion which has been drawn from it, in its
        application to the authority of the federal government over the militia, is as uncandid as
        it is illogical. What reason could there be to infer, that force was intended to be the sole
        instrument of authority, merely because there is a power to make use of it when necessary?
        What shall we think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in this manner?
        How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and judgment?</p>
      <p>By a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy, we are even taught to
        apprehend danger from the militia itself, in the hands of the federal government. It is
        observed that select corps may be formed, composed of the young and ardent, who may be
        rendered subservient to the views of arbitrary power. What plan for the regulation of the
        militia may be pursued by the national government, is impossible to be foreseen. But so far
        from viewing the matter in the same light with those who object to select corps as
        dangerous, were the Constitution ratified, and were I to deliver my sentiments to a member
        of the federal legislature from this State on the subject of a militia establishment, I
        should hold to him, in substance, the following discourse: "The project of disciplining all
        the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable
        of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business
        that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the
        attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the
        citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and
        evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would
        entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the
        people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss. It would form an annual deduction from
        the productive labor of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the present
        numbers of the people, would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil
        establishments of all the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor
        and industry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made,
        could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. Little more can reasonably be aimed
        at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and
        in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or
        twice in the course of a year. "But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must
        be abandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the utmost importance
        that a well-digested plan should, as soon as possible, be adopted for the proper
        establishment of the militia. The attention of the government ought particularly to be
        directed to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent, upon such principles as will
        really fit them for service in case of need. By thus circumscribing the plan, it will be
        possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia, ready to take the field whenever
        the defense of the State shall require it. This will not only lessen the call for military
        establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an
        army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while
        there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the
        use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.
        This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best
        possible security against it, if it should exist."</p>
      <p>Thus differently from the adversaries of the proposed Constitution should I reason on the
        same subject, deducing arguments of safety from the very sources which they represent as
        fraught with danger and perdition. But how the national legislature may reason on the point,
        is a thing which neither they nor I can foresee.</p>
      <p>There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of danger to liberty from
        the militia, that one is at a loss whether to treat it with gravity or with raillery;
        whether to consider it as a mere trial of skill, like the paradoxes of rhetoricians; as a
        disingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any price; or as the serious offspring of
        political fanaticism. Where in the name of common-sense, are our fears to end if we may not
        trust our sons, our brothers, our neighbors, our fellow-citizens? What shadow of danger can
        there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who
        participate with them in the same feelings, sentiments, habits and interests? What
        reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the Union to prescribe
        regulations for the militia, and to command its services when necessary, while the
        particular States are to have the SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS? If it were
        possible seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable establishment
        under the federal government, the circumstance of the officers being in the appointment of
        the States ought at once to extinguish it. There can be no doubt that this circumstance will
        always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia.</p>
      <p>In reading many of the publications against the Constitution, a man is apt to imagine that
        he is perusing some ill-written tale or romance, which instead of natural and agreeable
        images, exhibits to the mind nothing but frightful and distorted shapes "Gorgons, hydras,
        and chimeras dire"; discoloring and disfiguring whatever it represents, and transforming
        everything it touches into a monster.</p>
      <p>A sample of this is to be observed in the exaggerated and improbable suggestions which have
        taken place respecting the power of calling for the services of the militia. That of New
        Hampshire is to be marched to Georgia, of Georgia to New Hampshire, of New York to Kentucky,
        and of Kentucky to Lake Champlain. Nay, the debts due to the French and Dutch are to be paid
        in militiamen instead of louis d'ors and ducats. At one moment there is to be a large army
        to lay prostrate the liberties of the people; at another moment the militia of Virginia are
        to be dragged from their homes five or six hundred miles, to tame the republican contumacy
        of Massachusetts; and that of Massachusetts is to be transported an equal distance to subdue
        the refractory haughtiness of the aristocratic Virginians. Do the persons who rave at this
        rate imagine that their art or their eloquence can impose any conceits or absurdities upon
        the people of America for infallible truths?</p>
      <p>If there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of despotism, what need of the
        militia? If there should be no army, whither would the militia, irritated by being called
        upon to undertake a distant and hopeless expedition, for the purpose of riveting the chains
        of slavery upon a part of their countrymen, direct their course, but to the seat of the
        tyrants, who had meditated so foolish as well as so wicked a project, to crush them in their
        imagined intrenchments of power, and to make them an example of the just vengeance of an
        abused and incensed people? Is this the way in which usurpers stride to dominion over a
        numerous and enlightened nation? Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very
        instruments of their intended usurpations? Do they usually commence their career by wanton
        and disgustful acts of power, calculated to answer no end, but to draw upon themselves
        universal hatred and execration? Are suppositions of this sort the sober admonitions of
        discerning patriots to a discerning people? Or are they the inflammatory ravings of
        incendiaries or distempered enthusiasts? If we were even to suppose the national rulers
        actuated by the most ungovernable ambition, it is impossible to believe that they would
        employ such preposterous means to accomplish their designs.</p>
      <p>In times of insurrection, or invasion, it would be natural and proper that the militia of a
        neighboring State should be marched into another, to resist a common enemy, or to guard the
        republic against the violence of faction or sedition. This was frequently the case, in
        respect to the first object, in the course of the late war; and this mutual succor is,
        indeed, a principal end of our political association. If the power of affording it be placed
        under the direction of the Union, there will be no danger of a supine and listless
        inattention to the dangers of a neighbor, till its near approach had superadded the
        incitements of selfpreservation to the too feeble impulses of duty and sympathy.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 30</title>
    <p>Concerning the General Power of Taxation</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet.</p>
    <p>Friday, December 28, 1787.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>IT HAS been already observed that the federal government ought to possess the power of
        providing for the support of the national forces; in which proposition was intended to be
        included the expense of raising troops, of building and equipping fleets, and all other
        expenses in any wise connected with military arrangements and operations. But these are not
        the only objects to which the jurisdiction of the Union, in respect to revenue, must
        necessarily be empowered to extend. It must embrace a provision for the support of the
        national civil list; for the payment of the national debts contracted, or that may be
        contracted; and, in general, for all those matters which will call for disbursements out of
        the national treasury. The conclusion is, that there must be interwoven, in the frame of the
        government, a general power of taxation, in one shape or another.</p>
      <p>Money is, with propriety, considered as the vital principle of the body politic; as that
        which sustains its life and motion, and enables it to perform its most essential functions.
        A complete power, therefore, to procure a regular and adequate supply of it, as far as the
        resources of the community will permit, may be regarded as an indispensable ingredient in
        every constitution. From a deficiency in this particular, one of two evils must ensue;
        either the people must be subjected to continual plunder, as a substitute for a more
        eligible mode of supplying the public wants, or the government must sink into a fatal
        atrophy, and, in a short course of time, perish.</p>
      <p>In the Ottoman or Turkish empire, the sovereign, though in other respects absolute master
        of the lives and fortunes of his subjects, has no right to impose a new tax. The consequence
        is that he permits the bashaws or governors of provinces to pillage the people without
        mercy; and, in turn, squeezes out of them the sums of which he stands in need, to satisfy
        his own exigencies and those of the state. In America, from a like cause, the government of
        the Union has gradually dwindled into a state of decay, approaching nearly to annihilation.
        Who can doubt, that the happiness of the people in both countries would be promoted by
        competent authorities in the proper hands, to provide the revenues which the necessities of
        the public might require?</p>
      <p>The present Confederation, feeble as it is intended to repose in the United States, an
        unlimited power of providing for the pecuniary wants of the Union. But proceeding upon an
        erroneous principle, it has been done in such a manner as entirely to have frustrated the
        intention. Congress, by the articles which compose that compact (as has already been
        stated), are authorized to ascertain and call for any sums of money necessary, in their
        judgment, to the service of the United States; and their requisitions, if conformable to the
        rule of apportionment, are in every constitutional sense obligatory upon the States. These
        have no right to question the propriety of the demand; no discretion beyond that of devising
        the ways and means of furnishing the sums demanded. But though this be strictly and truly
        the case; though the assumption of such a right would be an infringement of the articles of
        Union; though it may seldom or never have been avowedly claimed, yet in practice it has been
        constantly exercised, and would continue to be so, as long as the revenues of the
        Confederacy should remain dependent on the intermediate agency of its members. What the
        consequences of this system have been, is within the knowledge of every man the least
        conversant in our public affairs, and has been amply unfolded in different parts of these
        inquiries. It is this which has chiefly contributed to reduce us to a situation, which
        affords ample cause both of mortification to ourselves, and of triumph to our enemies.</p>
      <p>What remedy can there be for this situation, but in a change of the system which has
        produced it in a change of the fallacious and delusive system of quotas and requisitions?
        What substitute can there be imagined for this ignis fatuus in finance, but that of
        permitting the national government to raise its own revenues by the ordinary methods of
        taxation authorized in every well-ordered constitution of civil government? Ingenious men
        may declaim with plausibility on any subject; but no human ingenuity can point out any other
        expedient to rescue us from the inconveniences and embarrassments naturally resulting from
        defective supplies of the public treasury.</p>
      <p>The more intelligent adversaries of the new Constitution admit the force of this reasoning;
        but they qualify their admission by a distinction between what they call INTERNAL and
        EXTERNAL taxation. The former they would reserve to the State governments; the latter, which
        they explain into commercial imposts, or rather duties on imported articles, they declare
        themselves willing to concede to the federal head. This distinction, however, would violate
        the maxim of good sense and sound policy, which dictates that every POWER ought to be in
        proportion to its OBJECT; and would still leave the general government in a kind of tutelage
        to the State governments, inconsistent with every idea of vigor or efficiency. Who can
        pretend that commercial imposts are, or would be, alone equal to the present and future
        exigencies of the Union? Taking into the account the existing debt, foreign and domestic,
        upon any plan of extinguishment which a man moderately impressed with the importance of
        public justice and public credit could approve, in addition to the establishments which all
        parties will acknowledge to be necessary, we could not reasonably flatter ourselves, that
        this resource alone, upon the most improved scale, would even suffice for its present
        necessities. Its future necessities admit not of calculation or limitation; and upon the
        principle, more than once adverted to, the power of making provision for them as they arise
        ought to be equally unconfined. I believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the
        history of mankind, that, IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN
        EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.</p>
      <p>To say that deficiencies may be provided for by requisitions upon the States, is on the one
        hand to acknowledge that this system cannot be depended upon, and on the other hand to
        depend upon it for every thing beyond a certain limit. Those who have carefully attended to
        its vices and deformities as they have been exhibited by experience or delineated in the
        course of these papers, must feel invincible repugnancy to trusting the national interests
        in any degree to its operation. Its inevitable tendency, whenever it is brought into
        activity, must be to enfeeble the Union, and sow the seeds of discord and contention between
        the federal head and its members, and between the members themselves. Can it be expected
        that the deficiencies would be better supplied in this mode than the total wants of the
        Union have heretofore been supplied in the same mode? It ought to be recollected that if
        less will be required from the States, they will have proportionably less means to answer
        the demand. If the opinions of those who contend for the distinction which has been
        mentioned were to be received as evidence of truth, one would be led to conclude that there
        was some known point in the economy of national affairs at which it would be safe to stop
        and to say: Thus far the ends of public happiness will be promoted by supplying the wants of
        government, and all beyond this is unworthy of our care or anxiety. How is it possible that
        a government half supplied and always necessitous, can fulfill the purposes of its
        institution, can provide for the security, advance the prosperity, or support the reputation
        of the commonwealth? How can it ever possess either energy or stability, dignity or credit,
        confidence at home or respectability abroad? How can its administration be any thing else
        than a succession of expedients temporizing, impotent, disgraceful? How will it be able to
        avoid a frequent sacrifice of its engagements to immediate necessity? How can it undertake
        or execute any liberal or enlarged plans of public good?</p>
      <p>Let us attend to what would be the effects of this situation in the very first war in which
        we should happen to be engaged. We will presume, for argument's sake, that the revenue
        arising from the impost duties answers the purposes of a provision for the public debt and
        of a peace establishment for the Union. Thus circumstanced, a war breaks out. What would be
        the probable conduct of the government in such an emergency? Taught by experience that
        proper dependence could not be placed on the success of requisitions, unable by its own
        authority to lay hold of fresh resources, and urged by considerations of national danger,
        would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds already appropriated from
        their proper objects to the defense of the State? It is not easy to see how a step of this
        kind could be avoided; and if it should be taken, it is evident that it would prove the
        destruction of public credit at the very moment that it was becoming essential to the public
        safety. To imagine that at such a crisis credit might be dispensed with, would be the
        extreme of infatuation. In the modern system of war, nations the most wealthy are obliged to
        have recourse to large loans. A country so little opulent as ours must feel this necessity
        in a much stronger degree. But who would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures
        for borrowing by an act which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the
        steadiness of its measures for paying? The loans it might be able to procure would be as
        limited in their extent as burdensome in their conditions. They would be made upon the same
        principles that usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors, with a sparing
        hand and at enormous premiums.</p>
      <p>It may perhaps be imagined that, from the scantiness of the resources of the country, the
        necessity of diverting the established funds in the case supposed would exist, though the
        national government should possess an unrestrained power of taxation. But two considerations
        will serve to quiet all apprehension on this head: one is, that we are sure the resources of
        the community, in their full extent, will be brought into activity for the benefit of the
        Union; the other is, that whatever deficiences there may be, can without difficulty be
        supplied by loans.</p>
      <p>The power of creating new funds upon new objects of taxation, by its own authority, would
        enable the national government to borrow as far as its necessities might require.
        Foreigners, as well as the citizens of America, could then reasonably repose confidence in
        its engagements; but to depend upon a government that must itself depend upon thirteen other
        governments for the means of fulfilling its contracts, when once its situation is clearly
        understood, would require a degree of credulity not often to be met with in the pecuniary
        transactions of mankind, and little reconcilable with the usual sharp-sightedness of
        avarice.</p>
      <p>Reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men who hope to see realized in
        America the halcyon scenes of the poetic or fabulous age; but to those who believe we are
        likely to experience a common portion of the vicissitudes and calamities which have fallen
        to the lot of other nations, they must appear entitled to serious attention. Such men must
        behold the actual situation of their country with painful solicitude, and deprecate the
        evils which ambition or revenge might, with too much facility, inflict upon it.</p>

    <p>The Same Subject Continued (Concerning the General Power of Taxation)</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet.</p>
    <p>Tuesday, January 1, 1788.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>IN DISQUISITIONS of every kind, there are certain primary truths, or first principles, upon
        which all subsequent reasonings must depend. These contain an internal evidence which,
        antecedent to all reflection or combination, commands the assent of the mind. Where it
        produces not this effect, it must proceed either from some defect or disorder in the organs
        of perception, or from the influence of some strong interest, or passion, or prejudice. Of
        this nature are the maxims in geometry, that "the whole is greater than its part; things
        equal to the same are equal to one another; two straight lines cannot enclose a space; and
        all right angles are equal to each other." Of the same nature are these other maxims in
        ethics and politics, that there cannot be an effect without a cause; that the means ought to
        be proportioned to the end; that every power ought to be commensurate with its object; that
        there ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which is itself
        incapable of limitation. And there are other truths in the two latter sciences which, if
        they cannot pretend to rank in the class of axioms, are yet such direct inferences from
        them, and so obvious in themselves, and so agreeable to the natural and unsophisticated
        dictates of common-sense, that they challenge the assent of a sound and unbiased mind, with
        a degree of force and conviction almost equally irresistible.</p>
      <p>The objects of geometrical inquiry are so entirely abstracted from those pursuits which
        stir up and put in motion the unruly passions of the human heart, that mankind, without
        difficulty, adopt not only the more simple theorems of the science, but even those abstruse
        paradoxes which, however they may appear susceptible of demonstration, are at variance with
        the natural conceptions which the mind, without the aid of philosophy, would be led to
        entertain upon the subject. The INFINITE DIVISIBILITY of matter, or, in other words, the
        INFINITE divisibility of a FINITE thing, extending even to the minutest atom, is a point
        agreed among geometricians, though not less incomprehensible to common-sense than any of
        those mysteries in religion, against which the batteries of infidelity have been so
        industriously leveled.</p>
      <p>But in the sciences of morals and politics, men are found far less tractable. To a certain
        degree, it is right and useful that this should be the case. Caution and investigation are a
        necessary armor against error and imposition. But this untractableness may be carried too
        far, and may degenerate into obstinacy, perverseness, or disingenuity. Though it cannot be
        pretended that the principles of moral and political knowledge have, in general, the same
        degree of certainty with those of the mathematics, yet they have much better claims in this
        respect than, to judge from the conduct of men in particular situations, we should be
        disposed to allow them. The obscurity is much oftener in the passions and prejudices of the
        reasoner than in the subject. Men, upon too many occasions, do not give their own
        understandings fair play; but, yielding to some untoward bias, they entangle themselves in
        words and confound themselves in subtleties.</p>
      <p>How else could it happen (if we admit the objectors to be sincere in their opposition),
        that positions so clear as those which manifest the necessity of a general power of taxation
        in the government of the Union, should have to encounter any adversaries among men of
        discernment? Though these positions have been elsewhere fully stated, they will perhaps not
        be improperly recapitulated in this place, as introductory to an examination of what may
        have been offered by way of objection to them. They are in substance as follows:</p>
      <p>A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of
        the objects committed to its care, and to the complete execution of the trusts for which it
        is responsible, free from every other control but a regard to the public good and to the
        sense of the people.</p>
      <p>As the duties of superintending the national defense and of securing the public peace
        against foreign or domestic violence involve a provision for casualties and dangers to which
        no possible limits can be assigned, the power of making that provision ought to know no
        other bounds than the exigencies of the nation and the resources of the community.</p>
      <p>As revenue is the essential engine by which the means of answering the national exigencies
        must be procured, the power of procuring that article in its full extent must necessarily be
        comprehended in that of providing for those exigencies.</p>
      <p>As theory and practice conspire to prove that the power of procuring revenue is unavailing
        when exercised over the States in their collective capacities, the federal government must
        of necessity be invested with an unqualified power of taxation in the ordinary modes.</p>
      <p>Did not experience evince the contrary, it would be natural to conclude that the propriety
        of a general power of taxation in the national government might safely be permitted to rest
        on the evidence of these propositions, unassisted by any additional arguments or
        illustrations. But we find, in fact, that the antagonists of the proposed Constitution, so
        far from acquiescing in their justness or truth, seem to make their principal and most
        zealous effort against this part of the plan. It may therefore be satisfactory to analyze
        the arguments with which they combat it.</p>
      <p>Those of them which have been most labored with that view, seem in substance to amount to
        this: "It is not true, because the exigencies of the Union may not be susceptible of
        limitation, that its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined. Revenue is as requisite
        to the purposes of the local administrations as to those of the Union; and the former are at
        least of equal importance with the latter to the happiness of the people. It is, therefore,
        as necessary that the State governments should be able to command the means of supplying
        their wants, as that the national government should possess the like faculty in respect to
        the wants of the Union. But an indefinite power of taxation in the LATTER might, and
        probably would in time, deprive the FORMER of the means of providing for their own
        necessities; and would subject them entirely to the mercy of the national legislature. As
        the laws of the Union are to become the supreme law of the land, as it is to have power to
        pass all laws that may be NECESSARY for carrying into execution the authorities with which
        it is proposed to vest it, the national government might at any time abolish the taxes
        imposed for State objects upon the pretense of an interference with its own. It might allege
        a necessity of doing this in order to give efficacy to the national revenues. And thus all
        the resources of taxation might by degrees become the subjects of federal monopoly, to the
        entire exclusion and destruction of the State governments."</p>
      <p>This mode of reasoning appears sometimes to turn upon the supposition of usurpation in the
        national government; at other times it seems to be designed only as a deduction from the
        constitutional operation of its intended powers. It is only in the latter light that it can
        be admitted to have any pretensions to fairness. The moment we launch into conjectures about
        the usurpations of the federal government, we get into an unfathomable abyss, and fairly put
        ourselves out of the reach of all reasoning. Imagination may range at pleasure till it gets
        bewildered amidst the labyrinths of an enchanted castle, and knows not on which side to turn
        to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has so rashly adventured. Whatever
        may be the limits or modifications of the powers of the Union, it is easy to imagine an
        endless train of possible dangers; and by indulging an excess of jealousy and timidity, we
        may bring ourselves to a state of absolute scepticism and irresolution. I repeat here what I
        have observed in substance in another place, that all observations founded upon the danger
        of usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and structure of the government, not
        to the nature or extent of its powers. The State governments, by their original
        constitutions, are invested with complete sovereignty. In what does our security consist
        against usurpation from that quarter? Doubtless in the manner of their formation, and in a
        due dependence of those who are to administer them upon the people. If the proposed
        construction of the federal government be found, upon an impartial examination of it, to be
        such as to afford, to a proper extent, the same species of security, all apprehensions on
        the score of usurpation ought to be discarded.</p>
      <p>It should not be forgotten that a disposition in the State governments to encroach upon the
        rights of the Union is quite as probable as a disposition in the Union to encroach upon the
        rights of the State governments. What side would be likely to prevail in such a conflict,
        must depend on the means which the contending parties could employ toward insuring success.
        As in republics strength is always on the side of the people, and as there are weighty
        reasons to induce a belief that the State governments will commonly possess most influence
        over them, the natural conclusion is that such contests will be most apt to end to the
        disadvantage of the Union; and that there is greater probability of encroachments by the
        members upon the federal head, than by the federal head upon the members. But it is evident
        that all conjectures of this kind must be extremely vague and fallible: and that it is by
        far the safest course to lay them altogether aside, and to confine our attention wholly to
        the nature and extent of the powers as they are delineated in the Constitution. Every thing
        beyond this must be left to the prudence and firmness of the people; who, as they will hold
        the scales in their own hands, it is to be hoped, will always take care to preserve the
        constitutional equilibrium between the general and the State governments. Upon this ground,
        which is evidently the true one, it will not be difficult to obviate the objections which
        have been made to an indefinite power of taxation in the United States.</p>

    <p>The Same Subject Continued (Concerning the General Power of Taxation)</p>
    <p>From the Daily Advertiser.</p>
    <p>Thursday, January 3, 1788.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>ALTHOUGH I am of opinion that there would be no real danger of the consequences which seem
        to be apprehended to the State governments from a power in the Union to control them in the
        levies of money, because I am persuaded that the sense of the people, the extreme hazard of
        provoking the resentments of the State governments, and a conviction of the utility and
        necessity of local administrations for local purposes, would be a complete barrier against
        the oppressive use of such a power; yet I am willing here to allow, in its full extent, the
        justness of the reasoning which requires that the individual States should possess an
        independent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the supply of their
        own wants. And making this concession, I affirm that (with the sole exception of duties on
        imports and exports) they would, under the plan of the convention, retain that authority in
        the most absolute and unqualified sense; and that an attempt on the part of the national
        government to abridge them in the exercise of it, would be a violent assumption of power,
        unwarranted by any article or clause of its Constitution.</p>
      <p>An entire consolidation of the States into one complete national sovereignty would imply an
        entire subordination of the parts; and whatever powers might remain in them, would be
        altogether dependent on the general will. But as the plan of the convention aims only at a
        partial union or consolidation, the State governments would clearly retain all the rights of
        sovereignty which they before had, and which were not, by that act, EXCLUSIVELY delegated to
        the United States. This exclusive delegation, or rather this alienation, of State
        sovereignty, would only exist in three cases: where the Constitution in express terms
        granted an exclusive authority to the Union; where it granted in one instance an authority
        to the Union, and in another prohibited the States from exercising the like authority; and
        where it granted an authority to the Union, to which a similar authority in the States would
        be absolutely and totally CONTRADICTORY and REPUGNANT. I use these terms to distinguish this
        last case from another which might appear to resemble it, but which would, in fact, be
        essentially different; I mean where the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be
        productive of occasional interferences in the POLICY of any branch of administration, but
        would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of constitutional authority.
        These three cases of exclusive jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by
        the following instances: The last clause but one in the eighth section of the first article
        provides expressly that Congress shall exercise "EXCLUSIVE LEGISLATION" over the district to
        be appropriated as the seat of government. This answers to the first case. The first clause
        of the same section empowers Congress "TO LAY AND COLLECT TAXES, DUTIES, IMPOSTS AND
        EXCISES"; and the second clause of the tenth section of the same article declares that, "NO
        STATE SHALL, without the consent of Congress, LAY ANY IMPOSTS OR DUTIES ON IMPORTS OR
        EXPORTS, except for the purpose of executing its inspection laws." Hence would result an
        exclusive power in the Union to lay duties on imports and exports, with the particular
        exception mentioned; but this power is abridged by another clause, which declares that no
        tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State; in consequence of which
        qualification, it now only extends to the DUTIES ON IMPORTS. This answers to the second
        case. The third will be found in that clause which declares that Congress shall have power
        "to establish an UNIFORM RULE of naturalization throughout the United States." This must
        necessarily be exclusive; because if each State had power to prescribe a DISTINCT RULE,
        there could not be a UNIFORM RULE.</p>
      <p>A case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter, but which is in fact widely
        different, affects the question immediately under consideration. I mean the power of
        imposing taxes on all articles other than exports and imports. This, I contend, is
        manifestly a concurrent and coequal authority in the United States and in the individual
        States. There is plainly no expression in the granting clause which makes that power
        EXCLUSIVE in the Union. There is no independent clause or sentence which prohibits the
        States from exercising it. So far is this from being the case, that a plain and conclusive
        argument to the contrary is to be deduced from the restraint laid upon the States in
        relation to duties on imports and exports. This restriction implies an admission that, if it
        were not inserted, the States would possess the power it excludes; and it implies a further
        admission, that as to all other taxes, the authority of the States remains undiminished. In
        any other view it would be both unnecessary and dangerous; it would be unnecessary, because
        if the grant to the Union of the power of laying such duties implied the exclusion of the
        States, or even their subordination in this particular, there could be no need of such a
        restriction; it would be dangerous, because the introduction of it leads directly to the
        conclusion which has been mentioned, and which, if the reasoning of the objectors be just,
        could not have been intended; I mean that the States, in all cases to which the restriction
        did not apply, would have a concurrent power of taxation with the Union. The restriction in
        question amounts to what lawyers call a NEGATIVE PREGNANT that is, a NEGATION of one thing,
        and an AFFIRMANCE of another; a negation of the authority of the States to impose taxes on
        imports and exports, and an affirmance of their authority to impose them on all other
        articles. It would be mere sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them ABSOLUTELY
        from the imposition of taxes of the former kind, and to leave them at liberty to lay others
        SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL of the national legislature. The restraining or prohibitory clause
        only says, that they shall not, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS, lay such duties; and if we
        are to understand this in the sense last mentioned, the Constitution would then be made to
        introduce a formal provision for the sake of a very absurd conclusion; which is, that the
        States, WITH THE CONSENT of the national legislature, might tax imports and exports; and
        that they might tax every other article, UNLESS CONTROLLED by the same body. If this was the
        intention, why not leave it, in the first instance, to what is alleged to be the natural
        operation of the original clause, conferring a general power of taxation upon the Union? It
        is evident that this could not have been the intention, and that it will not bear a
        construction of the kind.</p>
      <p>As to a supposition of repugnancy between the power of taxation in the States and in the
        Union, it cannot be supported in that sense which would be requisite to work an exclusion of
        the States. It is, indeed, possible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by a
        State which might render it INEXPEDIENT that thus a further tax should be laid on the same
        article by the Union; but it would not imply a constitutional inability to impose a further
        tax. The quantity of the imposition, the expediency or inexpediency of an increase on either
        side, would be mutually questions of prudence; but there would be involved no direct
        contradiction of power. The particular policy of the national and of the State systems of
        finance might now and then not exactly coincide, and might require reciprocal forbearances.
        It is not, however a mere possibility of inconvenience in the exercise of powers, but an
        immediate constitutional repugnancy that can by implication alienate and extinguish a
        pre-existing right of sovereignty.</p>
      <p>The necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain cases results from the division of
        the sovereign power; and the rule that all authorities, of which the States are not
        explicitly divested in favor of the Union, remain with them in full vigor, is not a
        theoretical consequence of that division, but is clearly admitted by the whole tenor of the
        instrument which contains the articles of the proposed Constitution. We there find that,
        notwithstanding the affirmative grants of general authorities, there has been the most
        pointed care in those cases where it was deemed improper that the like authorities should
        reside in the States, to insert negative clauses prohibiting the exercise of them by the
        States. The tenth section of the first article consists altogether of such provisions. This
        circumstance is a clear indication of the sense of the convention, and furnishes a rule of
        interpretation out of the body of the act, which justifies the position I have advanced and
        refutes every hypothesis to the contrary.</p>

    <p>Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of</p>
    <p>Members</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet. Friday, February 22, 1788.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE natural order of the subject leads us to consider, in this place, that provision of the
        Constitution which authorizes the national legislature to regulate, in the last resort, the
        election of its own members. It is in these words: "The TIMES, PLACES, and MANNER of holding
        elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the
        legislature thereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter SUCH
        REGULATIONS, except as to the PLACES of choosing senators. "1 This provision has not only
        been declaimed against by those who condemn the Constitution in the gross, but it has been
        censured by those who have objected with less latitude and greater moderation; and, in one
        instance it has been thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the
        advocate of every other part of the system. I am greatly mistaken, notwithstanding, if there
        be any article in the whole plan more completely defensible than this. Its propriety rests
        upon the evidence of this plain proposition, that EVERY GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO CONTAIN IN
        ITSELF THE MEANS OF ITS OWN PRESERVATION. Every just reasoner will, at first sight, approve
        an adherence to this rule, in the work of the convention; and will disapprove every
        deviation from it which may not appear to have been dictated by the necessity of
        incorporating into the work some particular ingredient, with which a rigid conformity to the
        rule was incompatible. Even in this case, though he may acquiesce in the necessity, yet he
        will not cease to regard and to regret a departure from so fundamental a principle, as a
        portion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of future weakness, and
        perhaps anarchy.</p>
      <p>It will not be alleged, that an election law could have been framed and inserted in the
        Constitution, which would have been always applicable to every probable change in the
        situation of the country; and it will therefore not be denied, that a discretionary power
        over elections ought to exist somewhere. It will, I presume, be as readily conceded, that
        there were only three ways in which this power could have been reasonably modified and
        disposed: that it must either have been lodged wholly in the national legislature, or wholly
        in the State legislatures, or primarily in the latter and ultimately in the former. The last
        mode has, with reason, been preferred by the convention. They have submitted the regulation
        of elections for the federal government, in the first instance, to the local
        administrations; which, in ordinary cases, and when no improper views prevail, may be both
        more convenient and more satisfactory; but they have reserved to the national authority a
        right to interpose, whenever extraordinary circumstances might render that interposition
        necessary to its safety. Nothing can be more evident, than that an exclusive power of
        regulating elections for the national government, in the hands of the State legislatures,
        would leave the existence of the Union entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment
        annihilate it, by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to administer its affairs.
        It is to little purpose to say, that a neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely
        to take place. The constitutional possibility of the thing, without an equivalent for the
        risk, is an unanswerable objection. Nor has any satisfactory reason been yet assigned for
        incurring that risk. The extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can never be
        dignified with that character.</p>
      <p>If we are in a humor to presume abuses of power, it is as fair to presume them on the part
        of the State governments as on the part of the general government. And as it is more
        consonant to the rules of a just theory, to trust the Union with the care of its own
        existence, than to transfer that care to any other hands, if abuses of power are to be
        hazarded on the one side or on the other, it is more rational to hazard them where the power
        would naturally be placed, than where it would unnaturally be placed. Suppose an article had
        been introduced into the Constitution, empowering the United States to regulate the
        elections for the particular States, would any man have hesitated to condemn it, both as an
        unwarrantable transposition of power, and as a premeditated engine for the destruction of
        the State governments? The violation of principle, in this case, would have required no
        comment; and, to an unbiased observer, it will not be less apparent in the project of
        subjecting the existence of the national government, in a similar respect, to the pleasure
        of the State governments. An impartial view of the matter cannot fail to result in a
        conviction, that each, as far as possible, ought to depend on itself for its own
        preservation.</p>
      <p>As an objection to this position, it may be remarked that the constitution of the national
        Senate would involve, in its full extent, the danger which it is suggested might flow from
        an exclusive power in the State legislatures to regulate the federal elections. It may be
        alleged, that by declining the appointment of Senators, they might at any time give a fatal
        blow to the Union; and from this it may be inferred, that as its existence would be thus
        rendered dependent upon them in so essential a point, there can be no objection to
        intrusting them with it in the particular case under consideration. The interest of each
        State, it may be added, to maintain its representation in the national councils, would be a
        complete security against an abuse of the trust. This argument, though specious, will not,
        upon examination, be found solid. It is certainly true that the State legislatures, by
        forbearing the appointment of senators, may destroy the national government. But it will not
        follow that, because they have a power to do this in one instance, they ought to have it in
        every other. There are cases in which the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far
        more decisive, without any motive equally cogent with that which must have regulated the
        conduct of the convention in respect to the formation of the Senate, to recommend their
        admission into the system.</p>
      <p>So far as that construction may expose the Union to the possibility of injury from the
        State legislatures, it is an evil; but it is an evil which could not have been avoided
        without excluding the States, in their political capacities, wholly from a place in the
        organization of the national government. If this had been done, it would doubtless have been
        interpreted into an entire dereliction of the federal principle; and would certainly have
        deprived the State governments of that absolute safeguard which they will enjoy under this
        provision. But however wise it may have been to have submitted in this instance to an
        inconvenience, for the attainment of a necessary advantage or a greater good, no inference
        can be drawn from thence to favor an accumulation of the evil, where no necessity urges, nor
        any greater good invites. It may be easily discerned also that the national government would
        run a much greater risk from a power in the State legislatures over the elections of its
        House of Representatives, than from their power of appointing the members of its Senate. The
        senators are to be chosen for the period of six years; there is to be a rotation, by which
        the seats of a third part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two years; and no
        State is to be entitled to more than two senators; a quorum of the body is to consist of
        sixteen members.</p>
      <p>The joint result of these circumstances would be, that a temporary combination of a few
        States to intermit the appointment of senators, could neither annul the existence nor impair
        the activity of the body; and it is not from a general and permanent combination of the
        States that we can have any thing to fear. The first might proceed from sinister designs in
        the leading members of a few of the State legislatures; the last would suppose a fixed and
        rooted disaffection in the great body of the people, which will either never exist at all,
        or will, in all probability, proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the general
        government to the advancement of their happiness in which event no good citizen could desire
        its continuance. But with regard to the federal House of Representatives, there is intended
        to be a general election of members once in two years. If the State legislatures were to be
        invested with an exclusive power of regulating these elections, every period of making them
        would be a delicate crisis in the national situation, which might issue in a dissolution of
        the Union, if the leaders of a few of the most important States should have entered into a
        previous conspiracy to prevent an election. I shall not deny, that there is a degree of
        weight in the observation, that the interests of each State, to be represented in the
        federal councils, will be a security against the abuse of a power over its elections in the
        hands of the State legislatures. But the security will not be considered as complete, by
        those who attend to the force of an obvious distinction between the interest of the people
        in the public felicity, and the interest of their local rulers in the power and consequence
        of their offices.</p>
      <p>The people of America may be warmly attached to the government of the Union, at times when
        the particular rulers of particular States, stimulated by the natural rivalship of power,
        and by the hopes of personal aggrandizement, and supported by a strong faction in each of
        those States, may be in a very opposite temper. This diversity of sentiment between a
        majority of the people, and the individuals who have the greatest credit in their councils,
        is exemplified in some of the States at the present moment, on the present question. The
        scheme of separate confederacies, which will always nultiply the chances of ambition, will
        be a never failing bait to all such influential characters in the State administrations as
        are capable of preferring their own emolument and advancement to the public weal. With so
        effectual a weapon in their hands as the exclusive power of regulating elections for the
        national government, a combination of a few such men, in a few of the most considerable
        States, where the temptation will always be the strongest, might accomplish the destruction
        of the Union, by seizing the opportunity of some casual dissatisfaction among the people
        (and which perhaps they may themselves have excited), to discontinue the choice of members
        for the federal House of Representatives. It ought never to be forgotten, that a firm union
        of this country, under an efficient government, will probably be an increasing object of
        jealousy to more than one nation of Europe; and that enterprises to subvert it will
        sometimes originate in the intrigues of foreign powers, and will seldom fail to be
        patronized and abetted by some of them. Its preservation, therefore ought in no case that
        can be avoided, to be committed to the guardianship of any but those whose situation will
        uniformly beget an immediate interest in the faithful and vigilant performance of the
        trust.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 65</title>
    <p>The Powers of the Senate Continued</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet.</p>
    <p>Friday, March 7, 1788.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to the Senate, in a distinct
        capacity, are comprised in their participation with the executive in the appointment to
        offices, and in their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments. As in the
        business of appointments the executive will be the principal agent, the provisions relating
        to it will most properly be discussed in the examination of that department. We will,
        therefore, conclude this head with a view of the judicial character of the Senate.</p>
      <p>A well-constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an object not more to be desired
        than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly elective. The subjects of its
        jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in
        other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which
        may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries
        done immediately to the society itself. The prosecution of them, for this reason, will
        seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties
        more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with
        the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence,
        and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the
        greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of
        parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.</p>
      <p>The delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns the political reputation and
        existence of every man engaged in the administration of public affairs, speak for
        themselves. The difficulty of placing it rightly, in a government resting entirely on the
        basis of periodical elections, will as readily be perceived, when it is considered that the
        most conspicuous characters in it will, from that circumstance, be too often the leaders or
        the tools of the most cunning or the most numerous faction, and on this account, can hardly
        be expected to possess the requisite neutrality towards those whose conduct may be the
        subject of scrutiny.</p>
      <p>The convention, it appears, thought the Senate the most fit depositary of this important
        trust. Those who can best discern the intrinsic difficulty of the thing, will be least hasty
        in condemning that opinion, and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the arguments
        which may be supposed to have produced it.</p>
      <p>What, it may be asked, is the true spirit of the institution itself? Is it not designed as
        a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the conduct of public men? If this be the design of it,
        who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation
        themselves? It is not disputed that the power of originating the inquiry, or, in other
        words, of preferring the impeachment, ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the
        legislative body. Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement
        strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the inquiry?
        The model from which the idea of this institution has been borrowed, pointed out that course
        to the convention. In Great Britain it is the province of the House of Commons to prefer the
        impeachment, and of the House of Lords to decide upon it. Several of the State constitutions
        have followed the example. As well the latter, as the former, seem to have regarded the
        practice of impeachments as a bridle in the hands of the legislative body upon the executive
        servants of the government. Is not this the true light in which it ought to be regarded?</p>
      <p>Where else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or
        sufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN ITS
        OWN SITUATION, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality between an
        INDIVIDUAL accused, and the REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE, HIS ACCUSERS?</p>
      <p>Could the Supreme Court have been relied upon as answering this description? It is much to
        be doubted, whether the members of that tribunal would at all times be endowed with so
        eminent a portion of fortitude, as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a
        task; and it is still more to be doubted, whether they would possess the degree of credit
        and authority, which might, on certain occasions, be indispensable towards reconciling the
        people to a decision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by their
        immediate representatives. A deficiency in the first, would be fatal to the accused; in the
        last, dangerous to the public tranquillity. The hazard in both these respects, could only be
        avoided, if at all, by rendering that tribunal more numerous than would consist with a
        reasonable attention to economy. The necessity of a numerous court for the trial of
        impeachments, is equally dictated by the nature of the proceeding. This can never be tied
        down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors, or
        in the construction of it by the judges, as in common cases serve to limit the discretion of
        courts in favor of personal security. There will be no jury to stand between the judges who
        are to pronounce the sentence of the law, and the party who is to receive or suffer it. The
        awful discretion which a court of impeachments must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to
        infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the community, forbids
        the commitment of the trust to a small number of persons.</p>
      <p>These considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a conclusion, that the Supreme
        Court would have been an improper substitute for the Senate, as a court of impeachments.
        There remains a further consideration, which will not a little strengthen this conclusion.
        It is this: The punishment which may be the consequence of conviction upon impeachment, is
        not to terminate the chastisement of the offender. After having been sentenced to a
        perpetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence, and honors and emoluments of his
        country, he will still be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of
        law. Would it be proper that the persons who had disposed of his fame, and his most valuable
        rights as a citizen in one trial, should, in another trial, for the same offense, be also
        the disposers of his life and his fortune? Would there not be the greatest reason to
        apprehend, that error, in the first sentence, would be the parent of error in the second
        sentence? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any
        new lights which might be brought to vary the complexion of another decision? Those who know
        anything of human nature, will not hesitate to answer these questions in the affirmative;
        and will be at no loss to perceive, that by making the same persons judges in both cases,
        those who might happen to be the objects of prosecution would, in a great measure, be
        deprived of the double security intended them by a double trial. The loss of life and estate
        would often be virtually included in a sentence which, in its terms, imported nothing more
        than dismission from a present, and disqualification for a future, office. It may be said,
        that the intervention of a jury, in the second instance, would obviate the danger. But
        juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of judges. They are sometimes induced to
        find special verdicts, which refer the main question to the decision of the court. Who would
        be willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury acting under the
        auspices of judges who had predetermined his guilt?</p>
      <p>Would it have been an improvement of the plan, to have united the Supreme Court with the
        Senate, in the formation of the court of impeachments? This union would certainly have been
        attended with several advantages; but would they not have been overbalanced by the signal
        disadvantage, already stated, arising from the agency of the same judges in the double
        prosecution to which the offender would be liable? To a certain extent, the benefits of that
        union will be obtained from making the chief justice of the Supreme Court the president of
        the court of impeachments, as is proposed to be done in the plan of the convention; while
        the inconveniences of an entire incorporation of the former into the latter will be
        substantially avoided. This was perhaps the prudent mean. I forbear to remark upon the
        additional pretext for clamor against the judiciary, which so considerable an augmentation
        of its authority would have afforded.</p>
      <p>Would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the trial of impeachments, of
        persons wholly distinct from the other departments of the government? There are weighty
        arguments, as well against, as in favor of, such a plan. To some minds it will not appear a
        trivial objection, that it could tend to increase the complexity of the political machine,
        and to add a new spring to the government, the utility of which would at best be
        questionable. But an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of attention, is
        this: a court formed upon such a plan, would either be attended with a heavy expense, or
        might in practice be subject to a variety of casualties and inconveniences. It must either
        consist of permanent officers, stationary at the seat of government, and of course entitled
        to fixed and regular stipends, or of certain officers of the State governments to be called
        upon whenever an impeachment was actually depending. It will not be easy to imagine any
        third mode materially different, which could rationally be proposed. As the court, for
        reasons already given, ought to be numerous, the first scheme will be reprobated by every
        man who can compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying them. The
        second will be espoused with caution by those who will seriously consider the difficulty of
        collecting men dispersed over the whole Union; the injury to the innocent, from the
        procrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought against them; the
        advantage to the guilty, from the opportunities which delay would afford to intrigue and
        corruption; and in some cases the detriment to the State, from the prolonged inaction of men
        whose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have exposed them to the persecution
        of an intemperate or designing majority in the House of Representatives. Though this latter
        supposition may seem harsh, and might not be likely often to be verified, yet it ought not
        to be forgotten that the demon of faction will, at certain seasons, extend his sceptre over
        all numerous bodies of men.</p>
      <p>But though one or the other of the substitutes which have been examined, or some other that
        might be devised, should be thought preferable to the plan in this respect, reported by the
        convention, it will not follow that the Constitution ought for this reason to be rejected.
        If mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of government, until every part of it
        had been adjusted to the most exact standard of perfection, society would soon become a
        general scene of anarchy, and the world a desert. Where is the standard of perfection to be
        found? Who will undertake to unite the discordant opinions of a whole community, in the same
        judgment of it; and to prevail upon one conceited projector to renounce his INFALLIBLE
        criterion for the FALLIBLE criterion of his more CONCEITED NEIGHBOR? To answer the purpose
        of the adversaries of the Constitution, they ought to prove, not merely that particular
        provisions in it are not the best which might have been imagined, but that the plan upon the
        whole is bad and pernicious.</p>

    <p>The Executive Department</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet.</p>
    <p>Tuesday, March 11, 1788.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE constitution of the executive department of the proposed government, claims next our
        attention.</p>
      <p>There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater
        difficulty in the arrangement of it than this; and there is, perhaps, none which has been
        inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.</p>
      <p>Here the writers against the Constitution seem to have taken pains to signalize their
        talent of misrepresentation. <executive type="populist">Calculating upon the aversion of the people to monarchy, they
        have endeavored to enlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the
        intended President of the United States; not merely as the embryo, but as the full-grown
        progeny, of that detested parent.</executive> To establish the pretended affinity, they have not
        scrupled to draw resources even from the regions of fiction. The authorities of a
        magistrate, in few instances greater, in some instances less, than those of a governor of
        New York, have been magnified into more than royal prerogatives. <executive type="populist">He has been decorated with
        attributes superior in dignity and splendor to those of a king of Great Britain. He has been
        shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow and the imperial purple flowing in his
        train. He has been seated on a throne surrounded with minions and mistresses, giving
        audience to the envoys of foreign potentates, in all the supercilious pomp of majesty. The
        images of Asiatic despotism and voluptuousness have scarcely been wanting to crown the
        exaggerated scene. We have been taught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering
        janizaries, and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio.</executive></p>
      <p>Attempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or, it might rather be said, to metamorphose
        the object, render it necessary to take an accurate view of its real nature and form: in
        order as well to ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance, as to unmask the
        disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit resemblances which have been so
        insidiously, as well as industriously, propagated.</p>
      <p>In the execution of this task, there is no man who would not find it an arduous effort
        either to behold with moderation, or to treat with seriousness, the devices, not less weak
        than wicked, which have been contrived to pervert the public opinion in relation to the
        subject. They so far exceed the usual though unjustifiable licenses of party artifice, that
        even in a disposition the most candid and tolerant, they must force the sentiments which
        favor an indulgent construction of the conduct of political adversaries to give place to a
        voluntary and unreserved indignation. <executive type="populist">It is impossible not to bestow the imputation of
        deliberate imposture and deception upon the gross pretense of a similitude between a king of
        Great Britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that of the President of the
        United States.</executive> It is still more impossible to withhold that imputation from the rash and
        barefaced expedients which have been employed to give success to the attempted
        imposition.</p>
      <p>In one instance, which I cite as a sample of the general spirit, the temerity has proceeded
        so far as to ascribe to the President of the United States a power which by the instrument
        reported is EXPRESSLY allotted to the Executives of the individual States. I mean the power
        of filling casual vacancies in the Senate.</p>
      <p>This bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has been hazarded by a writer
        who (whatever may be his real merit) has had no inconsiderable share in the applauses of his
        party1; and who, upon this false and unfounded suggestion, has built a series of
        observations equally false and unfounded. Let him now be confronted with the evidence of the
        fact, and let him, if he be able, justify or extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered
        to the dictates of truth and to the rules of fair dealing.</p>
      <p><executive type="elitist">The second clause of the second section of the second article empowers the President of the
        United States "to nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint
        ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other
        OFFICERS of United States whose appointments are NOT in the Constitution OTHERWISE PROVIDED
        FOR, and WHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW." Immediately after this clause follows another
        in these words: "The President shall have power to fill up ?? VACANCIES that may happen
        DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE, by granting commissions which shall EXPIRE AT THE END OF
        THEIR NEXT SESSION."</executive><executive type="populist">It is from this last provision that the pretended power of the
        President to fill vacancies in the Senate has been deduced.</executive> A slight attention to the
        connection of the clauses, and to the obvious meaning of the terms, will satisfy us that the
        deduction is not even colorable.</p>
      <p><executive type="populist">The first of these two clauses, it is clear, only provides a mode for appointing such
        officers, "whose appointments are NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR in the Constitution, and which
        SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW"; of course it cannot extend to the appointments of senators,
        whose appointments are OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR in the Constitution2, and who are ESTABLISHED
        BY THE CONSTITUTION, and will not require a future establishment by law. This position will
        hardly be contested.</executive></p>
      <p>The last of these two clauses, it is equally clear, cannot be understood to comprehend the
        power of filling vacancies in the Senate, for the following reasons: First. The relation in
        which that clause stands to the other, which declares the general mode of appointing
        officers of the United States, denotes it to be nothing more than a supplement to the other,
        for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary method of appointment, in cases to which the
        general method was inadequate. The ordinary power of appointment is confined to the
        President and Senate JOINTLY, and can therefore only be exercised during the session of the
        Senate; <executive type="elitist">but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually in session
        for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might happen IN THEIR RECESS, which it
        might be necessary for the public service to fill without delay, the succeeding clause is
        evidently intended to authorize the President, SINGLY, to make temporary appointments
        "during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of
        their next session."</executive>Secondly. If this clause is to be considered as supplementary to the
        one which precedes, the VACANCIES of which it speaks must be construed to relate to the
        "officers" described in the preceding one; and this, we have seen, excludes from its
        description the members of the Senate. <executive type="populist">Thirdly. The time within which the power is to
        operate, "during the recess of the Senate," and the duration of the appointments, "to the
        end of the next session" of that body, conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision,
        which, if it had been intended to comprehend senators, would naturally have referred the
        temporary power of filling vacancies to the recess of the State legislatures, who are to
        make the permanent appointments, and not to the recess of the national Senate, who are to
        have no concern in those appointments; and would have extended the duration in office of the
        temporary senators to the next session of the legislature of the State, in whose
        representation the vacancies had happened, instead of making it to expire at the end of the
        ensuing session of the national Senate.</executive> The circumstances of the body authorized to make the
        permanent appointments would, of course, have governed the modification of a power which
        related to the temporary appointments; and as the national Senate is the body, whose
        situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the suggestion under examination
        has been founded, the vacancies to which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those
        officers in whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the President. But
        lastly, the first and second clauses of the third section of the first article, not only
        obviate all possibility of doubt, but destroy the pretext of misconception. <executive type="populist">The former
        provides, that "the Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each
        State, chosen BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF for six years"; and the latter directs, that, "if
        vacancies in that body should happen by resignation or otherwise, DURING THE RECESS OF THE
        LEGISLATURE OF ANY STATE, the Executive THEREOF may make temporary appointments until the
        NEXT MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE, which shall then fill such vacancies."</executive> Here is an express
        power given, in clear and unambiguous terms, to the State Executives, to fill casual
        vacancies in the Senate, by temporary appointments; which not only invalidates the
        supposition, that the clause before considered could have been intended to confer that power
        upon the President of the United States, but proves that this supposition, destitute as it
        is even of the merit of plausibility, must have originated in an intention to deceive the
        people, too palpable to be obscured by sophistry, too atrocious to be palliated by
        hypocrisy.</p>
      <p>I have taken the pains to select this instance of misrepresentation, and to place it in a
        clear and strong light, as an unequivocal proof of the unwarrantable arts which are
        practiced to prevent a fair and impartial judgment of the real merits of the Constitution
        submitted to the consideration of the people. Nor have I scrupled, in so flagrant a case, to
        allow myself a severity of animadversion little congenial with the general spirit of these
        papers. <executive type="populist">I hesitate not to submit it to the decision of any candid and honest adversary of
        the proposed government, whether language can furnish epithets of too much asperity, for so
        shameless and so prostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of America.</executive></p>

    <p>The Mode of Electing the President</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet.</p>
    <p>Friday, March 14, 1788.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United States is almost the only
        part of the system, of any consequence, which has escaped without severe censure, or which
        has received the slightest mark of approbation from its opponents. The most plausible of
        these, who has appeared in print, has even deigned to admit that the election of the
        President is pretty well guarded.1 I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to affirm,
        that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent. It unites in an eminent
        degree all the advantages, the union of which was to be wished for.</p>
      <p><executive type="populist">It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the person to
        whom so important a trust was to be confided. This end will be answered by committing the
        right of making it, not to any preestablished body, but to men chosen by the people for the
        special purpose, and at the particular conjuncture.</executive></p>
      <p>It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of
        analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to
        deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were
        proper to govern their choice. <executive type="elitist">A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens
        from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment
        requisite to such complicated investigations.</executive></p>
      <p>It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and
        disorder. <executive type="populist">This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to
        have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the
        United States. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under
        consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief.</executive> The choice of SEVERAL,
        to form an intermediate body of electors, will be much less apt to convulse the community
        with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of ONE who was himself to be
        the final object of the public wishes. <executive type="populist">And as the electors, chosen in each State, are to
        assemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen, this detached and divided situation
        will expose them much less to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from them to
        the people, than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.</executive></p>
      <p><executive type="populist">Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to
        cabal, intrigue, and corruption.</executive> These most deadly adversaries of republican government
        might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter, but
        chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How
        could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief
        magistracy of the Union? But the convention have guarded against all danger of this sort,
        with the most provident and judicious attention. <executive type="populist">They have not made the appointment of the
        President to depend on any preexisting bodies of men, who might be tampered with beforehand
        to prostitute their votes; but they have referred it in the first instance to an immediate
        act of the people of America, to be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and
        sole purpose of making the appointment. And they have excluded from eligibility to this
        trust, all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the
        President in office. No senator, representative, or other person holding a place of trust or
        profit under the United States, can be of the numbers of the electors. Thus without
        corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the election will at least enter
        upon the task free from any sinister bias.</executive> Their transient existence, and their detached
        situation, already taken notice of, afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so,
        to the conclusion of it. The business of corruption, when it is to embrace so considerable a
        number of men, requires time as well as means. Nor would it be found easy suddenly to embark
        them, dispersed as they would be over thirteen States, in any combinations founded upon
        motives, which though they could not properly be denominated corrupt, might yet be of a
        nature to mislead them from their duty.</p>
      <p><executive type="populist">Another and no less important desideratum was, that the Executive should be independent for
        his continuance in office on all but the people themselves. He might otherwise be tempted to
        sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was necessary to the duration
        of his official consequence.</executive> This advantage will also be secured, by making his re-election
        to depend on a special body of representatives, deputed by the society for the single
        purpose of making the important choice.</p>
      <p><executive type="populist">ll these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by the convention; which is,
        that the people of each State shall choose a number of persons as electors, equal to the
        number of senators and representatives of such State in the national government, who shall
        assemble within the State, and vote for some fit person as President.</executive> Their votes, thus
        given, are to be transmitted to the seat of the national government, and the person who may
        happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will be the President. <executive type="both">But as a
        majority of the votes might not always happen to centre in one man, and as it might be
        unsafe to permit less than a majority to be conclusive, it is provided that, in such a
        contingency, the House of Representatives shall select out of the candidates who shall have
        the five highest number of votes, the man who in their opinion may be best qualified for the
        office.</executive></p>
      <p><executive type="elitist">The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never
        fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite
        qualifications. Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone
        suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single State; but it will require other
        talents, and a different kind of merit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the
        whole Union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a
        successful candidate for the distinguished office of President of the United States.</executive> It will
        not be too strong to say, that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station
        filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue. And this will be thought no
        inconsiderable recommendation of the Constitution, by those who are able to estimate the
        share which the executive in every government must necessarily have in its good or ill
        administration. <executive type="elitist">Though we cannot acquiesce in the political heresy of the poet who says:
        "For forms of government let fools contest That which is best administered is best," yet we
        may safely pronounce, that the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency
        to produce a good administration.</executive></p>
      <p>The Vice-President is to be chosen in the same manner with the President; with this
        difference, that the Senate is to do, in respect to the former, what is to be done by the
        House of Representatives, in respect to the latter.</p>
      <p>The appointment of an extraordinary person, as Vice-President, has been objected to as
        superfluous, if not mischievous. It has been alleged, that it would have been preferable to
        have authorized the Senate to elect out of their own body an officer answering that
        description. But two considerations seem to justify the ideas of the convention in this
        respect. <executive type="populist">One is, that to secure at all times the possibility of a definite resolution of the
        body, it is necessary that the President should have only a casting vote.</executive> And to take the
        senator of any State from his seat as senator, to place him in that of President of the
        Senate, would be to exchange, in regard to the State from which he came, a constant for a
        contingent vote. <executive type="elitist">The other consideration is, that as the Vice-President may occasionally
        become a substitute for the President, in the supreme executive magistracy, all the reasons
        which recommend the mode of election prescribed for the one, apply with great if not with
        equal force to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable that in this, as in most
        other instances, the objection which is made would lie against the constitution of this
        State. We have a Lieutenant-Governor, chosen by the people at large, who presides in the
        Senate, and is the constitutional substitute for the Governor, in casualties similar to
        those which would authorize the Vice-President to exercise the authorities and discharge the
        duties of the President.</executive></p>

    <p>The Real Character of the Executive</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet.</p>
    <p>Friday, March 14, 1788.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>I PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed Executive, as they are marked
        out in the plan of the convention. This will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness
        of the representations which have been made in regard to it.</p>
      <p><executive type="elitist">The first thing which strikes our attention is, that the executive authority, with few
        exceptions, is to be vested in a single magistrate. This will scarcely, however, be
        considered as a point upon which any comparison can be grounded; for if, in this particular,
        there be a resemblance to the king of Great Britain, there is not less a resemblance to the
        Grand Seignior, to the khan of Tartary, to the Man of the Seven Mountains, or to the
        governor of New York.</executive></p>
      <p><executive type="elitist">That magistrate is to be elected for FOUR years; and is to be re-eligible as often as the
        people of the United States shall think him worthy of their confidence.</executive> In these
        circumstances there is a total dissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain, who is
        an HEREDITARY monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony descendible to his heirs forever;
        but there is a close analogy between HIM and a governor of New York, who is elected for
        THREE years, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission. If we consider how much
        less time would be requisite for establishing a dangerous influence in a single State, than
        for establishing a like influence throughout the United States, we must conclude that a
        duration of FOUR years for the Chief Magistrate of the Union is a degree of permanency far
        less to be dreaded in that office, than a duration of THREE years for a corresponding office
        in a single State.</p>
      <p><executive type="populist">The President of the United States would be liable to be impeached, tried, and, upon
        conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office;
        and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.</executive>
        The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred and inviolable; there is no constitutional
        tribunal to which he is amenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without
        involving the crisis of a national revolution. In this delicate and important circumstance
        of personal responsibility, <executive type="populist">the President of Confederated America would stand upon no better
        ground than a governor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of Maryland and
        Delaware.</executive></p>
      <p><executive type="both">The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have
        passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is
        to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses.</executive>
        The king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute negative upon the acts of the two
        houses of Parliament. The disuse of that power for a considerable time past does not affect
        the reality of its existence; and is to be ascribed wholly to the crown's having found the
        means of substituting influence to authority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the
        other of the two houses, to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which could seldom be
        exerted without hazarding some degree of national agitation. The qualified negative of the
        President differs widely from this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and tallies
        exactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of this State, of which
        the governor is a constituent part. <executive type="elitist">In this respect the power of the President would exceed
        that of the governor of New York, because the former would possess, singly, what the latter
        shares with the chancellor and judges; but it would be precisely the same with that of the
        governor of Massachusetts, whose constitution, as to this article, seems to have been the
        original from which the convention have copied.</executive></p>
      <p><executive type="both">The President is to be the "commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States,
        and of the militia of the several States, when called into the actual service of the United
        States.</executive> <executive type="elitist">He is to have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United
        States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT; to recommend to the consideration of Congress such
        measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; to convene, on extraordinary occasions,
        both houses of the legislature, or either of them, and, in case of disagreement between them
        WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF ADJOURNMENT, to adjourn them to such time as he shall think
        proper; to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and to commission all officers of
        the United States."</executive> <executive type="both">In most of these particulars, the power of the President will resemble
        equally that of the king of Great Britain and of the governor of New York.</executive> The most material
        points of difference are these: First. The President will have only the occasional command
        of such part of the militia of the nation as by legislative provision may be called into the
        actual service of the Union. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have at
        all times the entire command of all the militia within their several jurisdictions. <executive type="populist">In this
        article, therefore, the power of the President would be inferior to that of either the
        monarch or the governor.</executive> Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and
        navy of the United States. <executive type="elitist">In this respect his authority would be nominally the same with
        that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it.</executive> It would amount to
        nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces, as
        first General and admiral of the Confederacy; while that of the British king extends to the
        DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all which, by the
        Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature.1 The governor of New
        York, on the other hand, is by the constitution of the State vested only with the command of
        its militia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States expressly declare their
        governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well of the army as navy; and it may well be a
        question, whether those of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this
        instance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than could be claimed by a
        President of the United States. Thirdly. The power of the President, in respect to pardons,
        would extend to all cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The governor of New York may pardon
        in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for treason and murder. Is not the power
        of the governor, in this article, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than
        that of the President? All conspiracies and plots against the government, which have not
        been matured into actual treason, may be screened from punishment of every kind, by the
        interposition of the prerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore, should
        be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had been ripened into actual
        hostility he could insure his accomplices and adherents an entire impunity. A President of
        the Union, on the other hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in the
        ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any degree, from the effects of
        impeachment and conviction. <executive type="populist">Would not the prospect of a total indemnity for all the
        preliminary steps be a greater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise
        against the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption from death and
        confiscation, if the final execution of the design, upon an actual appeal to arms, should
        miscarry?</executive> Would this last expectation have any influence at all, when the probability was
        computed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might himself be involved in the
        consequences of the measure, and might be incapacitated by his agency in it from affording
        the desired impunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary to recollect,
        that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of treason is limited "to levying war upon
        the United States, and adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort"; and that by
        the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds. Fourthly. <executive type="populist">The President can only
        adjourn the national legislature in the single case of disagreement about the time of
        adjournment.</executive> The British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament. The governor
        of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this State for a limited time; a power
        which, in certain situations, may be employed to very important purposes.</p>
      <p><executive type="populist">The President is to have power, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make
        treaties, provided two thirds of the senators present concur.</executive> The king of Great Britain is
        the sole and absolute representative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of
        his own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of every other description.
        It has been insinuated, that his authority in this respect is not conclusive, and that his
        conventions with foreign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the
        ratification, of Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never heard of, until it was
        broached upon the present occasion. Every jurist2 of that kingdom, and every other man
        acquainted with its Constitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of
        making treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plentitude; and that the compacts entered
        into by the royal authority have the most complete legal validity and perfection,
        independent of any other sanction. The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing
        itself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the stipulations in a new treaty;
        and this may have possibly given birth to the imagination, that its co-operation was
        necessary to the obligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary interposition
        proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity of adjusting a most artificial and
        intricate system of revenue and commercial laws, to the changes made in them by the
        operation of the treaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new state of
        things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. <executive type="populist">In this respect, therefore, there is
        no comparison between the intended power of the President and the actual power of the
        British sovereign.</executive> The one can perform alone what the other can do only with the concurrence
        of a branch of the legislature. <executive type="elitist">It must be admitted, that, in this instance, the power of
        the federal Executive would exceed that of any State Executive. But this arises naturally
        from the sovereign power which relates to treaties.</executive> If the Confederacy were to be dissolved,
        it would become a question, whether the Executives of the several States were not solely
        invested with that delicate and important prerogative.</p>
      <p>The President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors and other public ministers.
        This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of
        authority. It is a circumstance which will be without consequence in the administration of
        the government; and it was far more convenient that it should be arranged in this manner,
        than that there should be a necessity of convening the legislature, or one of its branches,
        upon every arrival of a foreign minister, though it were merely to take the place of a
        departed predecessor.</p>
      <p><executive type="both">The President is to nominate, and, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE, to appoint
        ambassadors and other public ministers, judges of the Supreme Court, and in general all
        officers of the United States established by law, and whose appointments are not otherwise
        provided for by the Constitution.</executive> The king of Great Britain is emphatically and truly styled
        the fountain of honor. He not only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can
        confer titles of nobility at pleasure; and has the disposal of an immense number of church
        preferments. <executive type="populist">There is evidently a great inferiority in the power of the President, in this
        particular, to that of the British king; nor is it equal to that of the governor of New
        York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution of the State by the practice
        which has obtained under it.</executive> The power of appointment is with us lodged in a council,
        composed of the governor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly. The
        governor CLAIMS, and has frequently EXERCISED, the right of nomination, and is ENTITLED to a
        casting vote in the appointment. If he really has the right of nominating, his authority is
        in this respect equal to that of the President, and exceeds it in the article of the casting
        vote. In the national government, if the Senate should be divided, no appointment could be
        made; in the government of New York, if the council should be divided, the governor can turn
        the scale, and confirm his own nomination.3 If we compare the publicity which must
        necessarily attend the mode of appointment by the President and an entire branch of the
        national legislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the governor of New
        York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most four, and frequently with only two
        persons; and if we at the same time consider how much more easy it must be to influence the
        small number of which a council of appointment consists, than the considerable number of
        which the national Senate would consist, we cannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of
        the chief magistrate of this State, in the disposition of offices, must, in practice, be
        greatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union.</p>
      <p>Hence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of the President in the
        article of treaties, it would be difficult to determine whether that magistrate would, in
        the aggregate, possess more or less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears yet
        more unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel which has been attempted
        between him and the king of Great Britain. But to render the contrast in this respect still
        more striking, it may be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude into a
        closer group.</p>
      <p><executive type="populist">The President of the United States would be an officer elected by the people for FOUR
        years; the king of Great Britain is a perpetual and HEREDITARY prince.</executive> The one would be
        amenable to personal punishment and disgrace; the person of the other is sacred and
        inviolable. The one would have a QUALIFIED negative upon the acts of the legislative body;
        the other has an ABSOLUTE negative. The one would have a right to command the military and
        naval forces of the nation; the other, in addition to this right, possesses that of
        DECLARING war, and of RAISING and REGULATING fleets and armies by his own authority. The one
        would have a concurrent power with a branch of the legislature in the formation of treaties;
        the other is the SOLE POSSESSOR of the power of making treaties. The one would have a like
        concurrent authority in appointing to offices; the other is the sole author of all
        appointments. The one can confer no privileges whatever; the other can make denizens of
        aliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the rights incident to
        corporate bodies. The one can prescribe no rules concerning the commerce or currency of the
        nation; the other is in several respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity can
        establish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can lay embargoes for a
        limited time, can coin money, can authorize or prohibit the circulation of foreign coin. The
        one has no particle of spiritual jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and governor of
        the national church! <executive type="populist">What answer shall we give to those who would persuade us that things so
        unlike resemble each other? The same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a
        government, the whole power of which would be in the hands of the elective and periodical
        servants of the people, is an aristocracy, a monarchy, and a despotism.</executive></p>
      <p>PUBLIUS.</p>
      <p>1 A writer in a Pennsylvania paper, under the signature of TAMONY, has asserted that the
        king of Great Britain owes his prerogative as commander-in-chief to an annual mutiny bill.
        The truth is, on the contrary, that his prerogative, in this respect, is immemorial, and was
        only disputed, "contrary to all reason and precedent," as Blackstone vol. i., page 262,
        expresses it, by the Long Parliament of Charles I. but by the statute the 13th of Charles
        II., chap. 6, it was declared to be in the king alone, for that the sole supreme government
        and command of the militia within his Majesty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by
        sea and land, and of all forts and places of strength, EVER WAS AND IS the undoubted right
        of his Majesty and his royal predecessors, kings and queens of England, and that both or
        either house of Parliament cannot nor ought to pretend to the same.</p>
      <p>2 Vide Blackstone's "Commentaries," vol i., p. 257.</p>
      <p>3 Candor, however, demands an acknowledgment that I do not think the claim of the governor
        to a right of nomination well founded. Yet it is always justifiable to reason from the
        practice of a government, till its propriety has been constitutionally questioned. And
        independent of this claim, when we take into view the other considerations, and pursue them
        through all their consequences, we shall be inclined to draw much the same conclusion.

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 73</title>
    <p>The Provision For The Support of the Executive, and the Veto Power</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet.</p>
    <p>Friday, March 21, 1788.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the executive authority, is an
        adequate provision for its support. It is evident that, without proper attention to this
        article, the separation of the executive from the legislative department would be merely
        nominal and nugatory. The legislature, with a discretionary power over the salary and
        emoluments of the Chief Magistrate, could render him as obsequious to their will as they
        might think proper to make him. They might, in most cases, either reduce him by famine, or
        tempt him by largesses, to surrender at discretion his judgment to their inclinations. These
        expressions, taken in all the latitude of the terms, would no doubt convey more than is
        intended. There are men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of their
        duty; but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils; and in the main it will be found
        that a power over a man's support is a power over his will. If it were necessary to confirm
        so plain a truth by facts, examples would not be wanting, even in this country, of the
        intimidation or seduction of the Executive by the terrors or allurements of the pecuniary
        arrangements of the legislative body.</p>
      <p>It is not easy, therefore, to commend too highly the judicious attention which has been
        paid to this subject in the proposed Constitution. <executive type="both">It is there provided that "The President
        of the United States shall, at stated times, receive for his services a compensation WHICH
        SHALL NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED DURING THE PERIOD FOR WHICH HE SHALL HAVE BEEN
        ELECTED; and he SHALL NOT RECEIVE WITHIN THAT PERIOD ANY OTHER EMOLUMENT from the United
        States, or any of them."</executive> It is impossible to imagine any provision which would have been
        more eligible than this. The legislature, on the appointment of a President, is once for all
        to declare what shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which he
        shall have been elected. This done, they will have no power to alter it, either by increase
        or diminution, till a new period of service by a new election commences. They can neither
        weaken his fortitude by operating on his necessities, nor corrupt his integrity by appealing
        to his avarice. <executive type="both">Neither the Union, nor any of its members, will be at liberty to give, nor
        will he be at liberty to receive, any other emolument than that which may have been
        determined by the first act. He can, of course, have no pecuniary inducement to renounce or
        desert the independence intended for him by the Constitution.</executive></p>
      <p>The last of the requisites to energy, which have been enumerated, are competent powers. Let
        us proceed to consider those which are proposed to be vested in the President of the United
        States.</p>
      <p>The first thing that offers itself to our observation, <executive type="elitist">is the qualified negative of the
        President upon the acts or resolutions of the two houses of the legislature; or, in other
        words, his power of returning all bills with objections, to have the effect of preventing
        their becoming laws, unless they should afterwards be ratified by two thirds of each of the
        component members of the legislative body.</executive></p>
      <p>The propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights, and to absorb the
        powers, of the other departments, has been already suggested and repeated; the insufficiency
        of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each, has also been remarked upon; and
        the necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its own defense, has been
        inferred and proved. From these clear and indubitable principles results the propriety of a
        negative, either absolute or qualified, in the Executive, upon the acts of the legislative
        branches. <executive type="both">Without the one or the other, the former would be absolutely unable to defend
        himself against the depredations of the latter. He might gradually be stripped of his
        authorities by successive resolutions, or annihilated by a single vote.</executive> And in the one mode
        or the other, the legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in the
        same hands. If even no propensity had ever discovered itself in the legislative body to
        invade the rights of the Executive, the rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety
        would of themselves teach us, that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the other,
        but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of selfdefense.</p>
      <p><executive type="both">But the power in question has a further use. It not only serves as a shield to the
        Executive, but it furnishes an additional security against the enaction of improper laws.</executive> It
        establishes a salutary check upon the legislative body, calculated to guard the community
        against the effects of faction, precipitancy, or of any impulse unfriendly to the public
        good, which may happen to influence a majority of that body.</p>
      <p>The propriety of a negative has, upon some occasions, been combated by an observation, <executive type="populist">that
        it was not to be presumed a single man would possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of
        men; and that unless this presumption should be entertained, it would be improper to give
        the executive magistrate any species of control over the legislative body.</executive></p>
      <p>But this observation, when examined, will appear rather specious than solid. <executive type="elitist">The propriety
        of the thing does not turn upon the supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the
        Executive, but upon the supposition that the legislature will not be infallible; that the
        love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to encroach upon the rights of
        other members of the government; that a spirit of faction may sometimes pervert its
        deliberations; that impressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which
        itself, on maturer reflexion, would condemn.</executive> <executive type="elitist">The primary inducement to conferring the power
        in question upon the Executive is, to enable him to defend himself; the secondary one is to
        increase the chances in favor of the community against the passing of bad laws, through
        haste, inadvertence, or design.</executive> The oftener the measure is brought under examination, the
        greater the diversity in the situations of those who are to examine it, the less must be the
        danger of those errors which flow from want of due deliberation, or of those missteps which
        proceed from the contagion of some common passion or interest. It is far less probable, that
        culpable views of any kind should infect all the parts of the government at the same moment
        and in relation to the same object, than that they should by turns govern and mislead every
        one of them.</p>
      <p><executive type="elitist">It may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws includes that of preventing
        good ones; and may be used to the one purpose as well as to the other.</executive> But this objection
        will have little weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that
        inconstancy and mutability in the laws, which form the greatest blemish in the character and
        genius of our governments. They will consider every institution calculated to restrain the
        excess of law-making, and to keep things in the same state in which they happen to be at any
        given period, as much more likely to do good than harm; because it is favorable to greater
        stability in the system of legislation. <executive type="elitist">The injury which may possibly be done by defeating a
        few good laws, will be amply compensated by the advantage of preventing a number of bad
        ones.</executive></p>
      <p>Nor is this all. The superior weight and influence of the legislative body in a free
        government, and the hazard to the Executive in a trial of strength with that body, afford a
        satisfactory security that the negative would generally be employed with great caution; and
        there would oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of rashness in the exercise of it.
        A king of Great Britain, with all his train of sovereign attributes, and with all the
        influence he draws from a thousand sources, would, at this day, hesitate to put a negative
        upon the joint resolutions of the two houses of Parliament. He would not fail to exert the
        utmost resources of that influence to strangle a measure disagreeable to him, in its
        progress to the throne, to avoid being reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take
        effect, or of risking the displeasure of the nation by an opposition to the sense of the
        legislative body. Nor is it probable, that he would ultimately venture to exert his
        prerogatives, but in a case of manifest propriety, or extreme necessity. All well-informed
        men in that kingdom will accede to the justness of this remark. A very considerable period
        has elapsed since the negative of the crown has been exercised.</p>
      <p><executive type="populist">If a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a British monarch, would have scruples
        about the exercise of the power under consideration, how much greater caution may be
        reasonably expected in a President of the United States, clothed for the short period of
        four years with the executive authority of a government wholly and purely republican?</executive></p>
      <p><executive type="both">It is evident that there would be greater danger of his not using his power when necessary,
        than of his using it too often, or too much.</executive> An argument, indeed, against its expediency,
        has been drawn from this very source. It has been represented, on this account, as a power
        odious in appearance, useless in practice. But it will not follow, that because it might be
        rarely exercised, it would never be exercised. In the case for which it is chiefly designed,
        that of an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights of the Executive, or in a case in
        which the public good was evidently and palpably sacrificed, a man of tolerable firmness
        would avail himself of his constitutional means of defense, and would listen to the
        admonitions of duty and responsibility. <executive type="elitist">In the former supposition, his fortitude would be
        stimulated by his immediate interest in the power of his office; in the latter, by the
        probability of the sanction of his constituents, who, though they would naturally incline to
        the legislative body in a doubtful case, would hardly suffer their partiality to delude them
        in a very plain case.</executive> I speak now with an eye to a magistrate possessing only a common share
        of firmness. There are men who, under any circumstances, will have the courage to do their
        duty at every hazard.</p>
      <p>But the convention have pursued a mean in this business, which will both facilitate the
        exercise of the power vested in this respect in the executive magistrate, and make its
        efficacy to depend on the sense of a considerable part of the legislative body. Instead of
        an absolute negative, it is proposed to give the Executive the qualified negative already
        described. This is a power which would be much more readily exercised than the other. A man
        who might be afraid to defeat a law by his single VETO, might not scruple to return it for
        reconsideration; subject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one third
        of each house concurring in the sufficiency of his objections. <executive type="populist">He would be encouraged by the
        reflection, that if his opposition should prevail, it would embark in it a very respectable
        proportion of the legislative body, whose influence would be united with his in supporting
        the propriety of his conduct in the public opinion.</executive> A direct and categorical negative has
        something in the appearance of it more harsh, and more apt to irritate, than the mere
        suggestion of argumentative objections to be approved or disapproved by those to whom they
        are addressed. In proportion as it would be less apt to offend, it would be more apt to be
        exercised; and for this very reason, it may in practice be found more effectual. It is to be
        hoped that it will not often happen that improper views will govern so large a proportion as
        two thirds of both branches of the legislature at the same time; and this, too, in spite of
        the counterposing weight of the Executive. It is at any rate far less probable that this
        should be the case, than that such views should taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare
        majority. <executive type="elitist">A power of this nature in the Executive, will often have a silent and unperceived,
        though forcible, operation. When men, engaged in unjustifiable pursuits, are aware that
        obstructions may come from a quarter which they cannot control, they will often be
        restrained by the bare apprehension of opposition, from doing what they would with eagerness
        rush into, if no such external impediments were to be feared.</executive></p>
      <p>This qualified negative, as has been elsewhere remarked, is in this State vested in a
        council, consisting of the governor, with the chancellor and judges of the Supreme Court, or
        any two of them. It has been freely employed upon a variety of occasions, and frequently
        with success. <executive type="elitist">And its utility has become so apparent, that persons who, in compiling the
        Constitution, were violent opposers of it, have from experience become its declared
        admirers.1</executive></p>
      <p>I have in another place remarked, that the convention, in the formation of this part of
        their plan, had departed from the model of the constitution of this State, in favor of that
        of Massachusetts. Two strong reasons may be imagined for this preference. One is that the
        judges, who are to be the interpreters of the law, might receive an improper bias, from
        having given a previous opinion in their revisionary capacities; the other is that by being
        often associated with the Executive, they might be induced to embark too far in the
        political views of that magistrate, and thus a dangerous combination might by degrees be
        cemented between the executive and judiciary departments. It is impossible to keep the
        judges too distinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws. <executive type="populist">It is
        peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be either corrupted or influenced by
        the Executive.</executive></p>

    <p>The Command of the Military and Naval Forces, and the Pardoning Power of the Executive</p>
    <p>From the New York Packet.</p>
    <p>Tuesday, March 25, 1788.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE President of the United States is to be "commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the
        United States, and of the militia of the several States WHEN CALLED INTO THE ACTUAL SERVICE
        of the United States." The propriety of this provision is so evident in itself, and it is,
        at the same time, so consonant to the precedents of the State constitutions in general, that
        little need be said to explain or enforce it. Even those of them which have, in other
        respects, coupled the chief magistrate with a council, have for the most part concentrated
        the military authority in him alone. Of all the cares or concerns of government, the
        direction of war most peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of
        power by a single hand. The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength;
        and the power of directing and employing the common strength, forms a usual and essential
        part in the definition of the executive authority. "The President may require the opinion,
        in writing, of the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any subject
        relating to the duties of their respective officers." This I consider as a mere redundancy
        in the plan, as the right for which it provides would result of itself from the office.</p>
      <p>He is also to be authorized to grant "reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United
        States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT." Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that
        the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed.
        The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity, that without an
        easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance
        too sanguinary and cruel. As the sense of responsibility is always strongest, in proportion
        as it is undivided, it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend to
        the force of those motives which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law, and
        least apt to yield to considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its
        vengeance. The reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature depended on his sole fiat,
        would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution; the dread of being accused of weakness
        or connivance, would beget equal circumspection, though of a different kind. On the other
        hand, as men generally derive confidence from their numbers, they might often encourage each
        other in an act of obduracy, and might be less sensible to the apprehension of suspicion or
        censure for an injudicious or affected clemency. On these accounts, one man appears to be a
        more eligible dispenser of the mercy of government, than a body of men.</p>
      <p>The expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the President has, if I mistake not,
        been only contested in relation to the crime of treason. This, it has been urged, ought to
        have depended upon the assent of one, or both, of the branches of the legislative body. I
        shall not deny that there are strong reasons to be assigned for requiring in this particular
        the concurrence of that body, or of a part of it. As treason is a crime levelled at the
        immediate being of the society, when the laws have once ascertained the guilt of the
        offender, there seems a fitness in referring the expediency of an act of mercy towards him
        to the judgment of the legislature. And this ought the rather to be the case, as the
        supposition of the connivance of the Chief Magistrate ought not to be entirely excluded. But
        there are also strong objections to such a plan. It is not to be doubted, that a single man
        of prudence and good sense is better fitted, in delicate conjunctures, to balance the
        motives which may plead for and against the remission of the punishment, than any numerous
        body whatever. It deserves particular attention, that treason will often be connected with
        seditions which embrace a large proportion of the community; as lately happened in
        Massachusetts. In every such case, we might expect to see the representation of the people
        tainted with the same spirit which had given birth to the offense. And when parties were
        pretty equally matched, the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the condemned
        person, availing itself of the good-nature and weakness of others, might frequently bestow
        impunity where the terror of an example was necessary. On the other hand, when the sedition
        had proceeded from causes which had inflamed the resentments of the major party, they might
        often be found obstinate and inexorable, when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and
        clemency. But the principal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this case to the
        Chief Magistrate is this: in seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical
        moments, when a welltimed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the
        tranquillity of the commonwealth; and which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it may never be
        possible afterwards to recall. The dilatory process of convening the legislature, or one of
        its branches, for the purpose of obtaining its sanction to the measure, would frequently be
        the occasion of letting slip the golden opportunity. The loss of a week, a day, an hour, may
        sometimes be fatal. If it should be observed, that a discretionary power, with a view to
        such contingencies, might be occasionally conferred upon the President, it may be answered
        in the first place, that it is questionable, whether, in a limited Constitution, that power
        could be delegated by law; and in the second place, that it would generally be impolitic
        beforehand to take any step which might hold out the prospect of impunity. A proceeding of
        this kind, out of the usual course, would be likely to be construed into an argument of
        timidity or of weakness, and would have a tendency to embolden guilt.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 78</title>
    <p>The Judiciary Department</p>
    <p>From McLEAN'S Edition, New York.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>WE PROCEED now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed
        government.</p>
      <p>In unfolding the defects of the existing Confederation, the utility and necessity of a
        federal judicature have been clearly pointed out. It is the less necessary to recapitulate
        the considerations there urged, as the propriety of the institution in the abstract is not
        disputed; the only questions which have been raised being relative to the manner of
        constituting it, and to its extent. To these points, therefore, our observations shall be
        confined.</p>
      <p>The manner of constituting it seems to embrace these several objects: 1st. The mode of
        appointing the judges. 2d. The tenure by which they are to hold their places. 3d. The
        partition of the judiciary authority between different courts, and their relations to each
        other.</p>
      <p>First. As to the mode of appointing the judges; this is the same with that of appointing
        the officers of the Union in general, and has been so fully discussed in the two last
        numbers, that nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition.</p>
      <p>Second. As to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places; this chiefly
        concerns their duration in office; the provisions for their support; the precautions for
        their responsibility.</p>
      <p>According to the plan of the convention, all judges who may be appointed by the United
        States are to hold their offices DURING GOOD BEHAVIOR; which is conformable to the most
        approved of the State constitutions and among the rest, to that of this State. Its propriety
        having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan, is no light symptom of the
        rage for objection, which disorders their imaginations and judgments. The standard of good
        behavior for the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the
        most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government. In a monarchy it is
        an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince; in a republic it is a no less excellent
        barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body. And it is the best
        expedient which can be devised in any government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial
        administration of the laws.</p>
      <p>Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive, that, in a
        government in which they are separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of
        its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the
        Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The Executive
        not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not
        only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every
        citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either
        the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society;
        and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor
        WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even
        for the efficacy of its judgments.</p>
      <p>This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves
        incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments
        of power1; that it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that all
        possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks. It equally
        proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of
        justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean
        so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive.
        For I agree, that "there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the
        legislative and executive powers."2 And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can
        have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its
        union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects of such a union must
        ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent
        separation; that as, from the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual
        jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; and that as
        nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office,
        this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its
        constitution, and, in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public
        security.</p>
      <p>The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited
        Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified
        exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills
        of attainder, no ex-post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved
        in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be
        to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this,
        all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.</p>
      <p>Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void,
        because contrary to the Constitution, has arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would
        imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power. It is urged that the
        authority which can declare the acts of another void, must necessarily be superior to the
        one whose acts may be declared void. As this doctrine is of great importance in all the
        American constitutions, a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests cannot be
        unacceptable.</p>
      <p>There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a
        delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is
        void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny
        this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is
        above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people
        themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not
        authorize, but what they forbid.</p>
      <p>If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their
        own powers, and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other
        departments, it may be answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it is
        not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. It is not otherwise
        to be supposed, that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the
        people to substitute their WILL to that of their constituents. It is far more rational to
        suppose, that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the
        legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to
        their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the
        courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental
        law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any
        particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an
        irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity
        ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be
        preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.</p>
      <p>Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the
        legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and
        that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to
        that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the
        latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental
        laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental.</p>
      <p>This exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between two contradictory laws, is
        exemplified in a familiar instance. It not uncommonly happens, that there are two statutes
        existing at one time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them
        containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case, it is the province of the
        courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation. So far as they can, by any fair
        construction, be reconciled to each other, reason and law conspire to dictate that this
        should be done; where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of necessity to give effect
        to one, in exclusion of the other. The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining
        their relative validity is, that the last in order of time shall be preferred to the first.
        But this is a mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the
        nature and reason of the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative
        provision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truth and propriety, for the direction
        of their conduct as interpreters of the law. They thought it reasonable, that between the
        interfering acts of an EQUAL authority, that which was the last indication of its will
        should have the preference.</p>
      <p>But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority, of an
        original and derivative power, the nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of
        that rule as proper to be followed. They teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to
        be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority; and that
        accordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty
        of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former.</p>
      <p>It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may
        substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature. This
        might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen
        in every adjudication upon any single statute. The courts must declare the sense of the law;
        and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would
        equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. The
        observation, if it prove any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct
        from that body.</p>
      <p>If, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited
        Constitution against legislative encroachments, this consideration will afford a strong
        argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much
        as this to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful
        performance of so arduous a duty.</p>
      <p>This independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the
        rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humors, which the arts of designing men,
        or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people
        themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information, and more
        deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to occasion dangerous innovations
        in the government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community. Though I
        trust the friends of the proposed Constitution will never concur with its enemies,3 in
        questioning that fundamental principle of republican government, which admits the right of
        the people to alter or abolish the established Constitution, whenever they find it
        inconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that
        the representatives of the people, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a
        majority of their constituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existing
        Constitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation of those provisions; or
        that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape,
        than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body. Until the
        people have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the established form,
        it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually; and no presumption, or
        even knowledge, of their sentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from
        it, prior to such an act. But it is easy to see, that it would require an uncommon portion
        of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution, where
        legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community.</p>
      <p>But it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only, that the independence of
        the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the
        society. These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of
        particular classes of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness of the
        judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the
        operation of such laws. It not only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those
        which may have been passed, but it operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing
        them; who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are to be
        expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled, by the very motives of
        the injustice they meditate, to qualify their attempts. This is a circumstance calculated to
        have more influence upon the character of our governments, than but few may be aware of. The
        benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more
        States than one; and though they may have displeased those whose sinister expectations they
        may have disappointed, they must have commanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuous
        and disinterested. Considerate men, of every description, ought to prize whatever will tend
        to beget or fortify that temper in the courts: as no man can be sure that he may not be
        to-morrow the victim of a spirit of injustice, by which he may be a gainer to-day. And every
        man must now feel, that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations
        of public and private confidence, and to introduce in its stead universal distrust and
        distress.</p>
      <p>That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the Constitution, and of
        individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice, can certainly
        not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission. Periodical
        appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be
        fatal to their necessary independence. If the power of making them was committed either to
        the Executive or legislature, there would be danger of an improper complaisance to the
        branch which possessed it; if to both, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the
        displeasure of either; if to the people, or to persons chosen by them for the special
        purpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity, to justify a reliance
        that nothing would be consulted but the Constitution and the laws.</p>
      <p>There is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of the judicial offices,
        which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require. It has been
        frequently remarked, with great propriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the
        inconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free government. To avoid an
        arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by
        strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every
        particular case that comes before them; and it will readily be conceived from the variety of
        controversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind, that the records of
        those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and must demand long
        and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them. Hence it is, that there can be
        but few men in the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for
        the stations of judges. And making the proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human
        nature, the number must be still smaller of those who unite the requisite integrity with the
        requisite knowledge. These considerations apprise us, that the government can have no great
        option between fit character; and that a temporary duration in office, which would naturally
        discourage such characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept a seat on
        the bench, would have a tendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less
        able, and less well qualified, to conduct it with utility and dignity. In the present
        circumstances of this country, and in those in which it is likely to be for a long time to
        come, the disadvantages on this score would be greater than they may at first sight appear;
        but it must be confessed, that they are far inferior to those which present themselves under
        the other aspects of the subject.</p>
      <p>Upon the whole, there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted wisely in copying
        from the models of those constitutions which have established GOOD BEHAVIOR as the tenure of
        their judicial offices, in point of duration; and that so far from being blamable on this
        account, their plan would have been inexcusably defective, if it had wanted this important
        feature of good government. The experience of Great Britain affords an illustrious comment
        on the excellence of the institution.</p>

    <p>The Judiciary Continued</p>
    <p>From MCLEAN's Edition, New York.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>NEXT to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges
        than a fixed provision for their support. The remark made in relation to the President is
        equally applicable here. In the general course of human nature, A POWER OVER A MAN's
        SUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL. And we can never hope to see realized in
        practice, the complete separation of the judicial from the legislative power, in any system
        which leaves the former dependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the
        latter. The enlightened friends to good government in every State, have seen cause to lament
        the want of precise and explicit precautions in the State constitutions on this head. Some
        of these indeed have declared that PERMANENT1 salaries should be established for the judges;
        but the experiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently
        definite to preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and unequivocal has
        been evinced to be requisite. The plan of the convention accordingly has provided that the
        judges of the United States "shall at STATED TIMES receive for their services a compensation
        which shall not be DIMINISHED during their continuance in office."</p>
      <p>This, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible provision that could have been
        devised. It will readily be understood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in
        the state of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the Constitution inadmissible.
        What might be extravagant to-day, might in half a century become penurious and inadequate.
        It was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its
        provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet under such restrictions as
        to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual for the
        worse. A man may then be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be deterred
        from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less eligible situation. The clause
        which has been quoted combines both advantages. The salaries of judicial officers may from
        time to time be altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the allowance
        with which any particular judge comes into office, in respect to him. It will be observed
        that a difference has been made by the convention between the compensation of the President
        and of the judges, That of the former can neither be increased nor diminished; that of the
        latter can only not be diminished. This probably arose from the difference in the duration
        of the respective offices. As the President is to be elected for no more than four years, it
        can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the commencement of that period, will
        not continue to be such to its end. But with regard to the judges, who, if they behave
        properly, will be secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially in the
        early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would be very sufficient at their
        first appointment, would become too small in the progress of their service.</p>
      <p>This provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy; and
        it may be safely affirmed that, together with the permanent tenure of their offices, it
        affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of
        any of the States in regard to their own judges.</p>
      <p>The precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the article respecting
        impeachments. They are liable to be impeached for malconduct by the House of
        Representatives, and tried by the Senate; and, if convicted, may be dismissed from office,
        and disqualified for holding any other. This is the only provision on the point which is
        consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial character, and is the only one
        which we find in our own Constitution in respect to our own judges.</p>
      <p>The want of a provision for removing the judges on account of inability has been a subject
        of complaint. But all considerate men will be sensible that such a provision would either
        not be practiced upon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any good
        purpose. The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, I believe, no place in the
        catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix the boundary between the regions of ability and
        inability, would much oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and enmities than
        advance the interests of justice or the public good. The result, except in the case of
        insanity, must for the most part be arbitrary; and insanity, without any formal or express
        provision, may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification.</p>
      <p>The constitution of New York, to avoid investigations that must forever be vague and
        dangerous, has taken a particular age as the criterion of inability. No man can be a judge
        beyond sixty. I believe there are few at present who do not disapprove of this provision.
        There is no station, in relation to which it is less proper than to that of a judge. The
        deliberating and comparing faculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that
        period in men who survive it; and when, in addition to this circumstance, we consider how
        few there are who outlive the season of intellectual vigor, and how improbable it is that
        any considerable portion of the bench, whether more or less numerous, should be in such a
        situation at the same time, we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of this sort have
        little to recommend them. In a republic, where fortunes are not affluent, and pensions not
        expedient, the dismission of men from stations in which they have served their country long
        and usefully, on which they depend for subsistence, and from which it will be too late to
        resort to any other occupation for a livelihood, ought to have some better apology to
        humanity than is to be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 80</title>
    <p>The Powers of the Judiciary</p>
    <p>From McLEAN's Edition, New York.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>To JUDGE with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal judicature, it will be necessary
        to consider, in the first place, what are its proper objects.</p>
      <p>It seems scarcely to admit of controversy, that the judicary authority of the Union ought
        to extend to these several descriptions of cases: 1st, to all those which arise out of the
        laws of the United States, passed in pursuance of their just and constitutional powers of
        legislation; 2d, to all those which concern the execution of the provisions expressly
        contained in the articles of Union; 3d, to all those in which the United States are a party;
        4th, to all those which involve the PEACE of the CONFEDERACY, whether they relate to the
        intercourse between the United States and foreign nations, or to that between the States
        themselves; 5th, to all those which originate on the high seas, and are of admiralty or
        maritime jurisdiction; and, lastly, to all those in which the State tribunals cannot be
        supposed to be impartial and unbiased.</p>
      <p>The first point depends upon this obvious consideration, that there ought always to be a
        constitutional method of giving efficacy to constitutional provisions. What, for instance,
        would avail restrictions on the authority of the State legislatures, without some
        constitutional mode of enforcing the observance of them? The States, by the plan of the
        convention, are prohibited from doing a variety of things, some of which are incompatible
        with the interests of the Union, and others with the principles of good government. The
        imposition of duties on imported articles, and the emission of paper money, are specimens of
        each kind. No man of sense will believe, that such prohibitions would be scrupulously
        regarded, without some effectual power in the government to restrain or correct the
        infractions of them. This power must either be a direct negative on the State laws, or an
        authority in the federal courts to overrule such as might be in manifest contravention of
        the articles of Union. There is no third course that I can imagine. The latter appears to
        have been thought by the convention preferable to the former, and, I presume, will be most
        agreeable to the States.</p>
      <p>As to the second point, it is impossible, by any argument or comment, to make it clearer
        than it is in itself. If there are such things as political axioms, the propriety of the
        judicial power of a government being coextensive with its legislative, may be ranked among
        the number. The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws,
        decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same
        causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but
        contradiction and confusion can proceed.</p>
      <p>Still less need be said in regard to the third point. Controversies between the nation and
        its members or citizens, can only be properly referred to the national tribunals. Any other
        plan would be contrary to reason, to precedent, and to decorum.</p>
      <p>The fourth point rests on this plain proposition, that the peace of the WHOLE ought not to
        be left at the disposal of a PART. The Union will undoubtedly be answerable to foreign
        powers for the conduct of its members. And the responsibility for an injury ought ever to be
        accompanied with the faculty of preventing it. As the denial or perversion of justice by the
        sentences of courts, as well as in any other manner, is with reason classed among the just
        causes of war, it will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all
        causes in which the citizens of other countries are concerned. This is not less essential to
        the preservation of the public faith, than to the security of the public tranquillity. A
        distinction may perhaps be imagined between cases arising upon treaties and the laws of
        nations and those which may stand merely on the footing of the municipal law. The former
        kind may be supposed proper for the federal jurisdiction, the latter for that of the States.
        But it is at least problematical, whether an unjust sentence against a foreigner, where the
        subject of controversy was wholly relative to the lex loci, would not, if unredressed, be an
        aggression upon his sovereign, as well as one which violated the stipulations of a treaty or
        the general law of nations. And a still greater objection to the distinction would result
        from the immense difficulty, if not impossibility, of a practical discrimination between the
        cases of one complexion and those of the other. So great a proportion of the cases in which
        foreigners are parties, involve national questions, that it is by far most safe and most
        expedient to refer all those in which they are concerned to the national tribunals.</p>
      <p>The power of determining causes between two States, between one State and the citizens of
        another, and between the citizens of different States, is perhaps not less essential to the
        peace of the Union than that which has been just examined. History gives us a horrid picture
        of the dissensions and private wars which distracted and desolated Germany prior to the
        institution of the Imperial Chamber by Maximilian, towards the close of the fifteenth
        century; and informs us, at the same time, of the vast influence of that institution in
        appeasing the disorders and establishing the tranquillity of the empire. This was a court
        invested with authority to decide finally all differences among the members of the Germanic
        body.</p>
      <p>A method of terminating territorial disputes between the States, under the authority of the
        federal head, was not unattended to, even in the imperfect system by which they have been
        hitherto held together. But there are many other sources, besides interfering claims of
        boundary, from which bickerings and animosities may spring up among the members of the
        Union. To some of these we have been witnesses in the course of our past experience. It will
        readily be conjectured that I allude to the fraudulent laws which have been passed in too
        many of the States. And though the proposed Constitution establishes particular guards
        against the repetition of those instances which have heretofore made their appearance, yet
        it is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit which produced them will assume new shapes,
        that could not be foreseen nor specifically provided against. Whatever practices may have a
        tendency to disturb the harmony between the States, are proper objects of federal
        superintendence and control.</p>
      <p>It may be esteemed the basis of the Union, that "the citizens of each State shall be
        entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States." And if it
        be a just principle that every government OUGHT TO POSSESS THE MEANS OF EXECUTING ITS OWN
        PROVISIONS BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY, it will follow, that in order to the inviolable maintenance
        of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the Union will be
        entitled, the national judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one State or its
        citizens are opposed to another State or its citizens. To secure the full effect of so
        fundamental a provision against all evasion and subterfuge, it is necessary that its
        construction should be committed to that tribunal which, having no local attachments, will
        be likely to be impartial between the different States and their citizens, and which, owing
        its official existence to the Union, will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to
        the principles on which it is founded.</p>
      <p>The fifth point will demand little animadversion. The most bigoted idolizers of State
        authority have not thus far shown a disposition to deny the national judiciary the
        cognizances of maritime causes. These so generally depend on the laws of nations, and so
        commonly affect the rights of foreigners, that they fall within the considerations which are
        relative to the public peace. The most important part of them are, by the present
        Confederation, submitted to federal jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>The reasonableness of the agency of the national courts in cases in which the State
        tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial, speaks for itself. No man ought certainly to
        be a judge in his own cause, or in any cause in respect to which he has the least interest
        or bias. This principle has no inconsiderable weight in designating the federal courts as
        the proper tribunals for the determination of controversies between different States and
        their citizens. And it ought to have the same operation in regard to some cases between
        citizens of the same State. Claims to land under grants of different States, founded upon
        adverse pretensions of boundary, are of this description. The courts of neither of the
        granting States could be expected to be unbiased. The laws may have even prejudged the
        question, and tied the courts down to decisions in favor of the grants of the State to which
        they belonged. And even where this had not been done, it would be natural that the judges,
        as men, should feel a strong predilection to the claims of their own government.</p>
      <p>Having thus laid down and discussed the principles which ought to regulate the constitution
        of the federal judiciary, we will proceed to test, by these principles, the particular
        powers of which, according to the plan of the convention, it is to be composed. It is to
        comprehend "all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of the
        United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all
        cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty
        and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to
        controversies between two or more States; between a State and citizens of another State;
        between citizens of different States; between citizens of the same State claiming lands and
        grants of different States; and between a State or the citizens thereof and foreign states,
        citizens, and subjects." This constitutes the entire mass of the judicial authority of the
        Union. Let us now review it in detail. It is, then, to extend:</p>
      <p>First. To all cases in law and equity, ARISING UNDER THE CONSTITUTION and THE LAWS OF THE
        UNITED STATES. This corresponds with the two first classes of causes, which have been
        enumerated, as proper for the jurisdiction of the United States. It has been asked, what is
        meant by "cases arising under the Constitution," in contradiction from those "arising under
        the laws of the United States"? The difference has been already explained. All the
        restrictions upon the authority of the State legislatures furnish examples of it. They are
        not, for instance, to emit paper money; but the interdiction results from the Constitution,
        and will have no connection with any law of the United States. Should paper money,
        notwithstanding, be emited, the controversies concerning it would be cases arising under the
        Constitution and not the laws of the United States, in the ordinary signification of the
        terms. This may serve as a sample of the whole.</p>
      <p>It has also been asked, what need of the word "equity What equitable causes can grow out of
        the Constitution and laws of the United States? There is hardly a subject of litigation
        between individuals, which may not involve those ingredients of FRAUD, ACCIDENT, TRUST, or
        HARDSHIP, which would render the matter an object of equitable rather than of legal
        jurisdiction, as the distinction is known and established in several of the States. It is
        the peculiar province, for instance, of a court of equity to relieve against what are called
        hard bargains: these are contracts in which, though there may have been no direct fraud or
        deceit, sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law, yet there may have been some undue
        and unconscionable advantage taken of the necessities or misfortunes of one of the parties,
        which a court of equity would not tolerate. In such cases, where foreigners were concerned
        on either side, it would be impossible for the federal judicatories to do justice without an
        equitable as well as a legal jurisdiction. Agreements to convey lands claimed under the
        grants of different States, may afford another example of the necessity of an equitable
        jurisdiction in the federal courts. This reasoning may not be so palpable in those States
        where the formal and technical distinction between LAW and EQUITY is not maintained, as in
        this State, where it is exemplified by every day's practice.</p>
      <p>The judiciary authority of the Union is to extend:</p>
      <p>Second. To treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States,
        and to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. These belong to
        the fourth class of the enumerated cases, as they have an evident connection with the
        preservation of the national peace.</p>
      <p>Third. To cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. These form, altogether, the fifth
        of the enumerated classes of causes proper for the cognizance of the national courts.</p>
      <p>Fourth. To controversies to which the United States shall be a party. These constitute the
        third of those classes.</p>
      <p>Fifth. To controversies between two or more States; between a State and citizens of another
        State; between citizens of different States. These belong to the fourth of those classes,
        and partake, in some measure, of the nature of the last.</p>
      <p>Sixth. To cases between the citizens of the same State, CLAIMING LANDS UNDER GRANTS OF
        DIFFERENT STATES. These fall within the last class, and ARE THE ONLY INSTANCES IN WHICH THE
        PROPOSED CONSTITUTION DIRECTLY CONTEMPLATES THE COGNIZANCE OF DISPUTES BETWEEN THE CITIZENS
        OF THE SAME STATE.</p>
      <p>Seventh. To cases between a State and the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens,
        or subjects. These have been already explained to belong to the fourth of the enumerated
        classes, and have been shown to be, in a peculiar manner, the proper subjects of the
        national judicature.</p>
      <p>From this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary, as marked out in the
        Constitution, it appears that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to have
        governed the structure of that department, and which were necessary to the perfection of the
        system. If some partial inconviences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of
        any of them into the plan, it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will
        have ample authority to make such EXCEPTIONS, and to prescribe such regulations as will be
        calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences. The possibility of particular
        mischiefs can never be viewed, by a wellinformed mind, as a solid objection to a general
        principle, which is calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to obtain general
        advantages.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST. No. 81</title>
    <p>The Judiciary Continued, and the Distribution of the Judicial Authority</p>
    <p>From McLEAN's Edition, New York.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>LET US now return to the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts, and
        their relations to each other, "The judicial power of the United States is" (by the plan of
        the convention) "to be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the
        Congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish."1</p>
      <p>That there ought to be one court of supreme and final jurisdiction, is a proposition which
        is not likely to be contested. The reasons for it have been assigned in another place, and
        are too obvious to need repetition. The only question that seems to have been raised
        concerning it, is, whether it ought to be a distinct body or a branch of the legislature.
        The same contradiction is observable in regard to this matter which has been remarked in
        several other cases. The very men who object to the Senate as a court of impeachments, on
        the ground of an improper intermixture of powers, advocate, by implication at least, the
        propriety of vesting the ultimate decision of all causes, in the whole or in a part of the
        legislative body.</p>
      <p>The arguments, or rather suggestions, upon which this charge is founded, are to this
        effect: "The authority of the proposed Supreme Court of the United States, which is to be a
        separate and independent body, will be superior to that of the legislature. The power of
        construing the laws according to the SPIRIT of the Constitution, will enable that court to
        mould them into whatever shape it may think proper; especially as its decisions will not be
        in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative body. This is as
        unprecedented as it is dangerous. In Britain, the judical power, in the last resort, resides
        in the House of Lords, which is a branch of the legislature; and this part of the British
        government has been imitated in the State constitutions in general. The Parliament of Great
        Britain, and the legislatures of the several States, can at any time rectify, by law, the
        exceptionable decisions of their respective courts. But the errors and usurpations of the
        Supreme Court of the United States will be uncontrollable and remediless." This, upon
        examination, will be found to be made up altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived
        fact.</p>
      <p>In the first place, there is not a syllable in the plan under consideration which DIRECTLY
        empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the
        Constitution, or which gives them any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed
        by the courts of every State. I admit, however, that the Constitution ought to be the
        standard of construction for the laws, and that wherever there is an evident opposition, the
        laws ought to give place to the Constitution. But this doctrine is not deducible from any
        circumstance peculiar to the plan of the convention, but from the general theory of a
        limited Constitution; and as far as it is true, is equally applicable to most, if not to all
        the State governments. There can be no objection, therefore, on this account, to the federal
        judicature which will not lie against the local judicatures in general, and which will not
        serve to condemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative
        discretion.</p>
      <p>But perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist in the particular
        organization of the Supreme Court; in its being composed of a distinct body of magistrates,
        instead of being one of the branches of the legislature, as in the government of Great
        Britain and that of the State. To insist upon this point, the authors of the objection must
        renounce the meaning they have labored to annex to the celebrated maxim, requiring a
        separation of the departments of power. It shall, nevertheless, be conceded to them,
        agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the course of these papers, that it
        is not violated by vesting the ultimate power of judging in a PART of the legislative body.
        But though this be not an absolute violation of that excellent rule, yet it verges so nearly
        upon it, as on this account alone to be less eligible than the mode preferred by the
        convention. From a body which had even a partial agency in passing bad laws, we could rarely
        expect a disposition to temper and moderate them in the application. The same spirit which
        had operated in making them, would be too apt in interpreting them; still less could it be
        expected that men who had infringed the Constitution in the character of legislators, would
        be disposed to repair the breach in the character of judges. Nor is this all. Every reason
        which recommends the tenure of good behavior for judicial offices, militates against placing
        the judiciary power, in the last resort, in a body composed of men chosen for a limited
        period. There is an absurdity in referring the determination of causes, in the first
        instance, to judges of permanent standing; in the last, to those of a temporary and mutable
        constitution. And there is a still greater absurdity in subjecting the decisions of men,
        selected for their knowledge of the laws, acquired by long and laborious study, to the
        revision and control of men who, for want of the same advantage, cannot but be deficient in
        that knowledge. The members of the legislature will rarely be chosen with a view to those
        qualifications which fit men for the stations of judges; and as, on this account, there will
        be great reason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective information, so, on
        account of the natural propensity of such bodies to party divisions, there will be no less
        reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice.
        The habit of being continually marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stifle the
        voice both of law and of equity.</p>
      <p>These considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those States who have committed the
        judicial power, in the last resort, not to a part of the legislature, but to distinct and
        independent bodies of men. Contrary to the supposition of those who have represented the
        plan of the convention, in this respect, as novel and unprecedented, it is but a copy of the
        constitutions of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
        North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia; and the preference which has been given to
        those models is highly to be commended.</p>
      <p>It is not true, in the second place, that the Parliament of Great Britain, or the
        legislatures of the particular States, can rectify the exceptionable decisions of their
        respective courts, in any other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the
        United States. The theory, neither of the British, nor the State constitutions, authorizes
        the revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative act. Nor is there any thing in the
        proposed Constitution, more than in either of them, by which it is forbidden. In the former,
        as well as in the latter, the impropriety of the thing, on the general principles of law and
        reason, is the sole obstacle. A legislature, without exceeding its province, cannot reverse
        a determination once made in a particular case; though it may prescribe a new rule for
        future cases. This is the principle, and it applies in all its consequences, exactly in the
        same manner and extent, to the State governments, as to the national government now under
        consideration. Not the least difference can be pointed out in any view of the subject.</p>
      <p>It may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of judiciary encroachments on
        the legislative authority, which has been upon many occasions reiterated, is in reality a
        phantom. Particular misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may
        now and then happen; but they can never be so extensive as to amount to an inconvenience, or
        in any sensible degree to affect the order of the political system. This may be inferred
        with certainty, from the general nature of the judicial power, from the objects to which it
        relates, from the manner in which it is exercised, from its comparative weakness, and from
        its total incapacity to support its usurpations by force. And the inference is greatly
        fortified by the consideration of the important constitutional check which the power of
        instituting impeachments in one part of the legislative body, and of determining upon them
        in the other, would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department. This is
        alone a complete security. There never can be danger that the judges, by a series of
        deliberate usurpations on the authority of the legislature, would hazard the united
        resentment of the body intrusted with it, while this body was possessed of the means of
        punishing their presumption, by degrading them from their stations. While this ought to
        remove all apprehensions on the subject, it affords, at the same time, a cogent argument for
        constituting the Senate a court for the trial of impeachments.</p>
      <p>Having now examined, and, I trust, removed the objections to the distinct and independent
        organization of the Supreme Court, I proceed to consider the propriety of the power of
        constituting inferior courts,2 and the relations which will subsist between these and the
        former.</p>
      <p>The power of constituting inferior courts is evidently calculated to obviate the necessity
        of having recourse to the Supreme Court in every case of federal cognizance. It is intended
        to enable the national government to institute or AUTHORUZE, in each State or district of
        the United States, a tribunal competent to the determination of matters of national
        jurisdiction within its limits.</p>
      <p>But why, it is asked, might not the same purpose have been accomplished by the
        instrumentality of the State courts? This admits of different answers. Though the fitness
        and competency of those courts should be allowed in the utmost latitude, yet the substance
        of the power in question may still be regarded as a necessary part of the plan, if it were
        only to empower the national legislature to commit to them the cognizance of causes arising
        out of the national Constitution. To confer the power of determining such causes upon the
        existing courts of the several States, would perhaps be as much "to constitute tribunals,"
        as to create new courts with the like power. But ought not a more direct and explicit
        provision to have been made in favor of the State courts? There are, in my opinion,
        substantial reasons against such a provision: the most discerning cannot foresee how far the
        prevalency of a local spirit may be found to disqualify the local tribunals for the
        jurisdiction of national causes; whilst every man may discover, that courts constituted like
        those of some of the States would be improper channels of the judicial authority of the
        Union. State judges, holding their offices during pleasure, or from year to year, will be
        too little independent to be relied upon for an inflexible execution of the national laws.
        And if there was a necessity for confiding the original cognizance of causes arising under
        those laws to them there would be a correspondent necessity for leaving the door of appeal
        as wide as possible. In proportion to the grounds of confidence in, or distrust of, the
        subordinate tribunals, ought to be the facility or difficulty of appeals. And well satisfied
        as I am of the propriety of the appellate jurisdiction, in the several classes of causes to
        which it is extended by the plan of the convention. I should consider every thing calculated
        to give, in practice, an UNRESTRAINED COURSE to appeals, as a source of public and private
        inconvenience.</p>
      <p>I am not sure, but that it will be found highly expedient and useful, to divide the United
        States into four or five or half a dozen districts; and to institute a federal court in each
        district, in lieu of one in every State. The judges of these courts, with the aid of the
        State judges, may hold circuits for the trial of causes in the several parts of the
        respective districts. Justice through them may be administered with ease and despatch; and
        appeals may be safely circumscribed within a narrow compass. This plan appears to me at
        present the most eligible of any that could be adopted; and in order to it, it is necessary
        that the power of constituting inferior courts should exist in the full extent in which it
        is to be found in the proposed Constitution.</p>
      <p>These reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid mind, that the want of such a power would
        have been a great defect in the plan. Let us now examine in what manner the judicial
        authority is to be distributed between the supreme and the inferior courts of the Union. The
        Supreme Court is to be invested with original jurisdiction, only "in cases affecting
        ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and those in which A STATE shall be a
        party." Public ministers of every class are the immediate representatives of their
        sovereigns. All questions in which they are concerned are so directly connected with the
        public peace, that, as well for the preservation of this, as out of respect to the
        sovereignties they represent, it is both expedient and proper that such questions should be
        submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory of the nation. Though consuls have
        not in strictness a diplomatic character, yet as they are the public agents of the nations
        to which they belong, the same observation is in a great measure applicable to them. In
        cases in which a State might happen to be a party, it would ill suit its dignity to be
        turned over to an inferior tribunal. Though it may rather be a digression from the immediate
        subject of this paper, I shall take occasion to mention here a supposition which has excited
        some alarm upon very mistaken grounds. It has been suggested that an assignment of the
        public securities of one State to the citizens of another, would enable them to prosecute
        that State in the federal courts for the amount of those securities; a suggestion which the
        following considerations prove to be without foundation.</p>
      <p>It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual
        WITHOUT ITS CONSENT. This is the general sense, and the general practice of mankind; and the
        exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of
        every State in the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the
        plan of the convention, it will remain with the States, and the danger intimated must be
        merely ideal. The circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of State
        sovereignty were discussed in considering the article of taxation, and need not be repeated
        here. A recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us, that there is no
        color to pretend that the State governments would, by the adoption of that plan, be divested
        of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but
        that which flows from the obligations of good faith. The contracts between a nation and
        individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to
        a compulsive force. They confer no right of action, independent of the sovereign will. To
        what purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe? How could
        recoveries be enforced? It is evident, it could not be done without waging war against the
        contracting State; and to ascribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in
        destruction of a pre-existing right of the State governments, a power which would involve
        such a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.</p>
      <p>Let us resume the train of our observations. We have seen that the original jurisdiction of
        the Supreme Court would be confined to two classes of causes, and those of a nature rarely
        to occur. In all other cases of federal cognizance, the original jurisdiction would
        appertain to the inferior tribunals; and the Supreme Court would have nothing more than an
        appellate jurisdiction, "with such EXCEPTIONS and under such REGULATIONS as the Congress
        shall make."</p>
      <p>The propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called in question in regard
        to matters of law; but the clamors have been loud against it as applied to matters of fact.
        Some well-intentioned men in this State, deriving their notions from the language and forms
        which obtain in our courts, have been induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of
        the trial by jury, in favor of the civil-law mode of trial, which prevails in our courts of
        admiralty, probate, and chancery. A technical sense has been affixed to the term
        "appellate," which, in our law parlance, is commonly used in reference to appeals in the
        course of the civil law. But if I am not misinformed, the same meaning would not be given to
        it in any part of New England. There an appeal from one jury to another, is familiar both in
        language and practice, and is even a matter of course, until there have been two verdicts on
        one side. The word "appellate," therefore, will not be understood in the same sense in New
        England as in New York, which shows the impropriety of a technical interpretation derived
        from the jurisprudence of any particular State. The expression, taken in the abstract,
        denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review the proceedings of another,
        either as to the law or fact, or both. The mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or
        legislative provision (in a new government it must depend on the latter), and may be with or
        without the aid of a jury, as may be judged advisable. If, therefore, the re-examination of
        a fact once determined by a jury, should in any case be admitted under the proposed
        Constitution, it may be so regulated as to be done by a second jury, either by remanding the
        cause to the court below for a second trial of the fact, or by directing an issue
        immediately out of the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>But it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once ascertained by a jury, will
        be permitted in the Supreme Court. Why may not it be said, with the strictest propriety,
        when a writ of error is brought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this State,
        that the latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the law? It is true it cannot
        institute a new inquiry concerning the fact, but it takes cognizance of it as it appears
        upon the record, and pronounces the law arising upon it.3 This is jurisdiction of both fact
        and law; nor is it even possible to separate them. Though the common-law courts of this
        State ascertain disputed facts by a jury, yet they unquestionably have jurisdiction of both
        fact and law; and accordingly when the former is agreed in the pleadings, they have no
        recourse to a jury, but proceed at once to judgment. I contend, therefore, on this ground,
        that the expressions, "appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact," do not necessarily
        imply a re-examination in the Supreme Court of facts decided by juries in the inferior
        courts.</p>
      <p>The following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influenced the convention, in
        relation to this particular provision. The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (it
        may have been argued) will extend to causes determinable in different modes, some in the
        course of the COMMON LAW, others in the course of the CIVIL LAW. In the former, the revision
        of the law only will be, generally speaking, the proper province of the Supreme Court; in
        the latter, the re-examination of the fact is agreeable to usage, and in some cases, of
        which prize causes are an example, might be essential to the preservation of the public
        peace. It is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction should, in certain cases,
        extend in the broadest sense to matters of fact. It will not answer to make an express
        exception of cases which shall have been originally tried by a jury, because in the courts
        of some of the States ALL CAUSES are tried in this mode4; and such an exception would
        preclude the revision of matters of fact, as well where it might be proper, as where it
        might be improper. To avoid all inconveniencies, it will be safest to declare generally,
        that the Supreme Court shall possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and FACT, and
        that this jurisdiction shall be subject to such EXCEPTIONS and regulations as the national
        legislature may prescribe. This will enable the government to modify it in such a manner as
        will best answer the ends of public justice and security.</p>
      <p>This view of the matter, at any rate, puts it out of all doubt that the supposed ABOLITION
        of the trial by jury, by the operation of this provision, is fallacious and untrue. The
        legislature of the United States would certainly have full power to provide, that in appeals
        to the Supreme Court there should be no re-examination of facts where they had been tried in
        the original causes by juries. This would certainly be an authorized exception; but if, for
        the reason already intimated, it should be thought too extensive, it might be qualified with
        a limitation to such causes only as are determinable at common law in that mode of
        trial.</p>
      <p>The amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of the judicial department is
        this: that it has been carefully restricted to those causes which are manifestly proper for
        the cognizance of the national judicature; that in the partition of this authority a very
        small portion of original jurisdiction has been preserved to the Supreme Court, and the rest
        consigned to the subordinate tribunals; that the Supreme Court will possess an appellate
        jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, in all the cases referred to them, both subject to
        any EXCEPTIONS and REGULATIONS which may be thought advisable; that this appellate
        jurisdiction does, in no case, ABOLISH the trial by jury; and that an ordinary degree of
        prudence and integrity in the national councils will insure us solid advantages from the
        establishment of the proposed judiciary, without exposing us to any of the inconveniences
        which have been predicted from that source.</p>
      <p>PUBLIUS.</p>
      <p>1 Article 3, sec. I.</p>
      <p>2 This power has been absurdly represented as intended to abolish all the county courts in
        the several States, which are commonly called inferior courts. But the expressions of the
        Constitution are, to constitute "tribunals INFERIOR TO THE SUPREME COURT"; and the evident
        design of the provision is to enable the institution of local courts, subordinate to the
        Supreme, either in States or larger districts. It is ridiculous to imagine that county
        courts were in contemplation.</p>
      <p>3 This word is composed of JUS and DICTIO, juris dictio or a speaking and pronouncing of
        the law.</p>
      <p>4 I hold that the States will have concurrent jurisdiction with the subordinate federal
        judicatories, in many cases of federal cognizance, as will be explained in my next
        paper.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 83</title>
    <p>The Judiciary Continued in Relation to Trial by Jury</p>
    <p>From MCLEAN's Edition, New York.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>THE objection to the plan of the convention, which has met with most success in this State,
        and perhaps in several of the other States, is THAT RELATIVE TO THE WANT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL
        PROVISION for the trial by jury in civil cases. The disingenuous form in which this
        objection is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed, but continues to be
        pursued in all the conversations and writings of the opponents of the plan. The mere silence
        of the Constitution in regard to CIVIL CAUSES, is represented as an abolition of the trial
        by jury, and the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully calculated to
        induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is complete and universal, extending not
        only to every species of civil, but even to CRIMINAL CAUSES. To argue with respect to the
        latter would, however, be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the
        EXISTENCE of MATTER, or to demonstrate any of those propositions which, by their own
        internal evidence, force conviction, when expressed in language adapted to convey their
        meaning.</p>
      <p>With regard to civil causes, subtleties almost too contemptible for refutation have been
        employed to countenance the surmise that a thing which is only NOT PROVIDED FOR, is entirely
        ABOLISHED. Every man of discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between
        SILENCE and ABOLITION. But as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to support it by
        certain LEGAL MAXIMS of interpretation, which they have perverted from their true meaning,
        it may not be wholly useless to explore the ground they have taken.</p>
      <p>The maxims on which they rely are of this nature: "A specification of particulars is an
        exclusion of generals"; or, "The expression of one thing is the exclusion of another."
        Hence, say they, as the Constitution has established the trial by jury in criminal cases,
        and is silent in respect to civil, this silence is an implied prohibition of trial by jury
        in regard to the latter.</p>
      <p>The rules of legal interpretation are rules of COMMONSENSE, adopted by the courts in the
        construction of the laws. The true test, therefore, of a just application of them is its
        conformity to the source from which they are derived. This being the case, let me ask if it
        is consistent with common-sense to suppose that a provision obliging the legislative power
        to commit the trial of criminal causes to juries, is a privation of its right to authorize
        or permit that mode of trial in other cases? Is it natural to suppose, that a command to do
        one thing is a prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power to do,
        and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done? If such a supposition
        would be unnatural and unreasonable, it cannot be rational to maintain that an injunction of
        the trial by jury in certain cases is an interdiction of it in others.</p>
      <p>A power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of trial; and consequently,
        if nothing was said in the Constitution on the subject of juries, the legislature would be
        at liberty either to adopt that institution or to let it alone. This discretion, in regard
        to criminal causes, is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury in all such
        cases; but it is, of course, left at large in relation to civil causes, there being a total
        silence on this head. The specification of an obligation to try all criminal causes in a
        particular mode, excludes indeed the obligation or necessity of employing the same mode in
        civil causes, but does not abridge THE POWER of the legislature to exercise that mode if it
        should be thought proper. The pretense, therefore, that the national legislature would not
        be at full liberty to submit all the civil causes of federal cognizance to the determination
        of juries, is a pretense destitute of all just foundation.</p>
      <p>From these observations this conclusion results: that the trial by jury in civil cases
        would not be abolished; and that the use attempted to be made of the maxims which have been
        quoted, is contrary to reason and common-sense, and therefore not admissible. Even if these
        maxims had a precise technical sense, corresponding with the idea of those who employ them
        upon the present occasion, which, however, is not the case, they would still be inapplicable
        to a constitution of government. In relation to such a subject, the natural and obvious
        sense of its provisions, apart from any technical rules, is the true criterion of
        construction.</p>
      <p>Having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use made of them, let us
        endeavor to ascertain their proper use and true meaning. This will be best done by examples.
        The plan of the convention declares that the power of Congress, or, in other words, of the
        NATIONAL LEGISLATURE, shall extend to certain enumerated cases. This specification of
        particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a general legislative authority, because an
        affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd, as well as useless, if a general
        authority was intended.</p>
      <p>In like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures is declared by the
        Constitution to comprehend certain cases particularly specified. The expression of those
        cases marks the precise limits, beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their
        jurisdiction, because the objects of their cognizance being enumerated, the specification
        would be nugatory if it did not exclude all ideas of more extensive authority.</p>
      <p>These examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been mentioned, and to
        designate the manner in which they should be used. But that there may be no misapprehensions
        upon this subject, I shall add one case more, to demonstrate the proper use of these maxims,
        and the abuse which has been made of them.</p>
      <p>Let us suppose that by the laws of this State a married woman was incapable of conveying
        her estate, and that the legislature, considering this as an evil, should enact that she
        might dispose of her property by deed executed in the presence of a magistrate. In such a
        case there can be no doubt but the specification would amount to an exclusion of any other
        mode of conveyance, because the woman having no previous power to alienate her property, the
        specification determines the particular mode which she is, for that purpose, to avail
        herself of. But let us further suppose that in a subsequent part of the same act it should
        be declared that no woman should dispose of any estate of a determinate value without the
        consent of three of her nearest relations, signified by their signing the deed; could it be
        inferred from this regulation that a married woman might not procure the approbation of her
        relations to a deed for conveying property of inferior value? The position is too absurd to
        merit a refutation, and yet this is precisely the position which those must establish who
        contend that the trial by juries in civil cases is abolished, because it is expressly
        provided for in cases of a criminal nature.</p>
      <p>From these observations it must appear unquestionably true, that trial by jury is in no
        case abolished by the proposed Constitution, and it is equally true, that in those
        controversies between individuals in which the great body of the people are likely to be
        interested, that institution will remain precisely in the same situation in which it is
        placed by the State constitutions, and will be in no degree altered or influenced by the
        adoption of the plan under consideration. The foundation of this assertion is, that the
        national judiciary will have no cognizance of them, and of course they will remain
        determinable as heretofore by the State courts only, and in the manner which the State
        constitutions and laws prescribe. All land causes, except where claims under the grants of
        different States come into question, and all other controversies between the citizens of the
        same State, unless where they depend upon positive violations of the articles of union, by
        acts of the State legislatures, will belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of the State
        tribunals. Add to this, that admiralty causes, and almost all those which are of equity
        jurisdiction, are determinable under our own government without the intervention of a jury,
        and the inference from the whole will be, that this institution, as it exists with us at
        present, cannot possibly be affected to any great extent by the proposed alteration in our
        system of government.</p>
      <p>The friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing else,
        concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury; or if there is any difference
        between them it consists in this: the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty;
        the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government. For my own part, the more
        the operation of the institution has fallen under my observation, the more reason I have
        discovered for holding it in high estimation; and it would be altogether superfluous to
        examine to what extent it deserves to be esteemed useful or essential in a representative
        republic, or how much more merit it may be entitled to, as a defense against the oppressions
        of an hereditary monarch, than as a barrier to the tyranny of popular magistrates in a
        popular government. Discussions of this kind would be more curious than beneficial, as all
        are satisfied of the utility of the institution, and of its friendly aspect to liberty. But
        I must acknowledge that I cannot readily discern the inseparable connection between the
        existence of liberty, and the trial by jury in civil cases. Arbitrary impeachments,
        arbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses, and arbitrary punishments upon
        arbitrary convictions, have ever appeared to me to be the great engines of judicial
        despotism; and these have all relation to criminal proceedings. The trial by jury in
        criminal cases, aided by the habeas-corpus act, seems therefore to be alone concerned in the
        question. And both of these are provided for, in the most ample manner, in the plan of the
        convention.</p>
      <p>It has been observed, that trial by jury is a safeguard against an oppressive exercise of
        the power of taxation. This observation deserves to be canvassed.</p>
      <p>It is evident that it can have no influence upon the legislature, in regard to the AMOUNT
        of taxes to be laid, to the OBJECTS upon which they are to be imposed, or to the RULE by
        which they are to be apportioned. If it can have any influence, therefore, it must be upon
        the mode of collection, and the conduct of the officers intrusted with the execution of the
        revenue laws.</p>
      <p>As to the mode of collection in this State, under our own Constitution, the trial by jury
        is in most cases out of use. The taxes are usually levied by the more summary proceeding of
        distress and sale, as in cases of rent. And it is acknowledged on all hands, that this is
        essential to the efficacy of the revenue laws. The dilatory course of a trial at law to
        recover the taxes imposed on individuals, would neither suit the exigencies of the public
        nor promote the convenience of the citizens. It would often occasion an accumulation of
        costs, more burdensome than the original sum of the tax to be levied.</p>
      <p>And as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue, the provision in favor of trial by
        jury in criminal cases, will afford the security aimed at. Wilful abuses of a public
        authority, to the oppression of the subject, and every species of official extortion, are
        offenses against the government, for which the persons who commit them may be indicted and
        punished according to the circumstances of the case.</p>
      <p>The excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to depend on circumstances
        foreign to the preservation of liberty. The strongest argument in its favor is, that it is a
        security against corruption. As there is always more time and better opportunity to tamper
        with a standing body of magistrates than with a jury summoned for the occasion, there is
        room to suppose that a corrupt influence would more easily find its way to the former than
        to the latter. The force of this consideration is, however, diminished by others. The
        sheriff, who is the summoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks of courts, who have the
        nomination of special juries, are themselves standing officers, and, acting individually,
        may be supposed more accessible to the touch of corruption than the judges, who are a
        collective body. It is not difficult to see, that it would be in the power of those officers
        to select jurors who would serve the purpose of the party as well as a corrupted bench. In
        the next place, it may fairly be supposed, that there would be less difficulty in gaining
        some of the jurors promiscuously taken from the public mass, than in gaining men who had
        been chosen by the government for their probity and good character. But making every
        deduction for these considerations, the trial by jury must still be a valuable check upon
        corruption. It greatly multiplies the impediments to its success. As matters now stand, it
        would be necessary to corrupt both court and jury; for where the jury have gone evidently
        wrong, the court will generally grant a new trial, and it would be in most cases of little
        use to practice upon the jury, unless the court could be likewise gained. Here then is a
        double security; and it will readily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to
        preserve the purity of both institutions. By increasing the obstacles to success, it
        discourages attempts to seduce the integrity of either. The temptations to prostitution
        which the judges might have to surmount, must certainly be much fewer, while the
        co-operation of a jury is necessary, than they might be, if they had themselves the
        exclusive determination of all causes.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding, therefore, the doubts I have expressed, as to the essentiality of trial by
        jury in civil cases to liberty, I admit that it is in most cases, under proper regulations,
        an excellent method of determining questions of property; and that on this account alone it
        would be entitled to a constitutional provision in its favor if it were possible to fix the
        limits within which it ought to be comprehended. There is, however, in all cases, great
        difficulty in this; and men not blinded by enthusiasm must be sensible that in a federal
        government, which is a composition of societies whose ideas and institutions in relation to
        the matter materially vary from each other, that difficulty must be not a little augmented.
        For my own part, at every new view I take of the subject, I become more convinced of the
        reality of the obstacles which, we are authoritatively informed, prevented the insertion of
        a provision on this head in the plan of the convention.</p>
      <p>The great difference between the limits of the jury trial in different States is not
        generally understood; and as it must have considerable influence on the sentence we ought to
        pass upon the omission complained of in regard to this point, an explanation of it is
        necessary. In this State, our judicial establishments resemble, more nearly than in any
        other, those of Great Britain. We have courts of common law, courts of probates (analogous
        in certain matters to the spiritual courts in England), a court of admiralty and a court of
        chancery. In the courts of common law only, the trial by jury prevails, and this with some
        exceptions. In all the others a single judge presides, and proceeds in general either
        according to the course of the canon or civil law, without the aid of a jury.1 In New
        Jersey, there is a court of chancery which proceeds like ours, but neither courts of
        admiralty nor of probates, in the sense in which these last are established with us. In that
        State the courts of common law have the cognizance of those causes which with us are
        determinable in the courts of admiralty and of probates, and of course the jury trial is
        more extensive in New Jersey than in New York. In Pennsylvania, this is perhaps still more
        the case, for there is no court of chancery in that State, and its common-law courts have
        equity jurisdiction. It has a court of admiralty, but none of probates, at least on the plan
        of ours. Delaware has in these respects imitated Pennsylvania. Maryland approaches more
        nearly to New York, as does also Virginia, except that the latter has a plurality of
        chancellors. North Carolina bears most affinity to Pennsylvania; South Carolina to Virginia.
        I believe, however, that in some of those States which have distinct courts of admiralty,
        the causes depending in them are triable by juries. In Georgia there are none but common-law
        courts, and an appeal of course lies from the verdict of one jury to another, which is
        called a special jury, and for which a particular mode of appointment is marked out. In
        Connecticut, they have no distinct courts either of chancery or of admiralty, and their
        courts of probates have no jurisdiction of causes. Their common-law courts have admiralty
        and, to a certain extent, equity jurisdiction. In cases of importance, their General
        Assembly is the only court of chancery. In Connecticut, therefore, the trial by jury extends
        in PRACTICE further than in any other State yet mentioned. Rhode Island is, I believe, in
        this particular, pretty much in the situation of Connecticut. Massachusetts and New
        Hampshire, in regard to the blending of law, equity, and admiralty jurisdictions, are in a
        similar predicament. In the four Eastern States, the trial by jury not only stands upon a
        broader foundation than in the other States, but it is attended with a peculiarity unknown,
        in its full extent, to any of them. There is an appeal OF COURSE from one jury to another,
        till there have been two verdicts out of three on one side.</p>
      <p>From this sketch it appears that there is a material diversity, as well in the modification
        as in the extent of the institution of trial by jury in civil cases, in the several States;
        and from this fact these obvious reflections flow: first, that no general rule could have
        been fixed upon by the convention which would have corresponded with the circumstances of
        all the States; and secondly, that more or at least as much might have been hazarded by
        taking the system of any one State for a standard, as by omitting a provision altogether and
        leaving the matter, as has been done, to legislative regulation.</p>
      <p>The propositions which have been made for supplying the omission have rather served to
        illustrate than to obviate the difficulty of the thing. The minority of Pennsylvania have
        proposed this mode of expression for the purpose "Trial by jury shall be as heretofore" and
        this I maintain would be senseless and nugatory. The United States, in their united or
        collective capacity, are the OBJECT to which all general provisions in the Constitution must
        necessarily be construed to refer. Now it is evident that though trial by jury, with various
        limitations, is known in each State individually, yet in the United States, AS SUCH, it is
        at this time altogether unknown, because the present federal government has no judiciary
        power whatever; and consequently there is no proper antecedent or previous establishment to
        which the term HERETOFORE could relate. It would therefore be destitute of a precise
        meaning, and inoperative from its uncertainty.</p>
      <p>As, on the one hand, the form of the provision would not fulfil the intent of its
        proposers, so, on the other, if I apprehend that intent rightly, it would be in itself
        inexpedient. I presume it to be, that causes in the federal courts should be tried by jury,
        if, in the State where the courts sat, that mode of trial would obtain in a similar case in
        the State courts; that is to say, admiralty causes should be tried in Connecticut by a jury,
        in New York without one. The capricious operation of so dissimilar a method of trial in the
        same cases, under the same government, is of itself sufficient to indispose every
        wellregulated judgment towards it. Whether the cause should be tried with or without a jury,
        would depend, in a great number of cases, on the accidental situation of the court and
        parties.</p>
      <p>But this is not, in my estimation, the greatest objection. I feel a deep and deliberate
        conviction that there are many cases in which the trial by jury is an ineligible one. I
        think it so particularly in cases which concern the public peace with foreign nations that
        is, in most cases where the question turns wholly on the laws of nations. Of this nature,
        among others, are all prize causes. Juries cannot be supposed competent to investigations
        that require a thorough knowledge of the laws and usages of nations; and they will sometimes
        be under the influence of impressions which will not suffer them to pay sufficient regard to
        those considerations of public policy which ought to guide their inquiries. There would of
        course be always danger that the rights of other nations might be infringed by their
        decisions, so as to afford occasions of reprisal and war. Though the proper province of
        juries be to determine matters of fact, yet in most cases legal consequences are complicated
        with fact in such a manner as to render a separation impracticable.</p>
      <p>It will add great weight to this remark, in relation to prize causes, to mention that the
        method of determining them has been thought worthy of particular regulation in various
        treaties between different powers of Europe, and that, pursuant to such treaties, they are
        determinable in Great Britain, in the last resort, before the king himself, in his privy
        council, where the fact, as well as the law, undergoes a re-examination. This alone
        demonstrates the impolicy of inserting a fundamental provision in the Constitution which
        would make the State systems a standard for the national government in the article under
        consideration, and the danger of encumbering the government with any constitutional
        provisions the propriety of which is not indisputable.</p>
      <p>My convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the separation of the
        equity from the law jurisdiction, and that the causes which belong to the former would be
        improperly committed to juries. The great and primary use of a court of equity is to give
        relief IN EXTRAORDINARY CASES, which are EXCEPTIONS2 to general rules. To unite the
        jurisdiction of such cases with the ordinary jurisdiction, must have a tendency to unsettle
        the general rules, and to subject every case that arises to a SPECIAL determination; while a
        separation of the one from the other has the contrary effect of rendering one a sentinel
        over the other, and of keeping each within the expedient limits. Besides this, the
        circumstances that constitute cases proper for courts of equity are in many instances so
        nice and intricate, that they are incompatible with the genius of trials by jury. They
        require often such long, deliberate, and critical investigation as would be impracticable to
        men called from their occupations, and obliged to decide before they were permitted to
        return to them. The simplicity and expedition which form the distinguishing characters of
        this mode of trial require that the matter to be decided should be reduced to some single
        and obvious point; while the litigations usual in chancery frequently comprehend a long
        train of minute and independent particulars.</p>
      <p>It is true that the separation of the equity from the legal jurisdiction is peculiar to the
        English system of jurisprudence: which is the model that has been followed in several of the
        States. But it is equally true that the trial by jury has been unknown in every case in
        which they have been united. And the separation is essential to the preservation of that
        institution in its pristine purity. The nature of a court of equity will readily permit the
        extension of its jurisdiction to matters of law; but it is not a little to be suspected,
        that the attempt to extend the jurisdiction of the courts of law to matters of equity will
        not only be unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of chancery, on
        the plan upon which they are established in this State, but will tend gradually to change
        the nature of the courts of law, and to undermine the trial by jury, by introducing
        questions too complicated for a decision in that mode.</p>
      <p>These appeared to be conclusive reasons against incorporating the systems of all the
        States, in the formation of the national judiciary, according to what may be conjectured to
        have been the attempt of the Pennsylvania minority. Let us now examine how far the
        proposition of Massachusetts is calculated to remedy the supposed defect.</p>
      <p>It is in this form: "In civil actions between citizens of different States, every issue of
        fact, arising in ACTIONS AT COMMON LAW, may be tried by a jury if the parties, or either of
        them request it."</p>
      <p>This, at best, is a proposition confined to one description of causes; and the inference is
        fair, either that the Massachusetts convention considered that as the only class of federal
        causes, in which the trial by jury would be proper; or that if desirous of a more extensive
        provision, they found it impracticable to devise one which would properly answer the end. If
        the first, the omission of a regulation respecting so partial an object can never be
        considered as a material imperfection in the system. If the last, it affords a strong
        corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing.</p>
      <p>But this is not all: if we advert to the observations already made respecting the courts
        that subsist in the several States of the Union, and the different powers exercised by them,
        it will appear that there are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those which
        have been employed to characterize THAT species of causes which it is intended shall be
        entitled to a trial by jury. In this State, the boundaries between actions at common law and
        actions of equitable jurisdiction, are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevail
        in England upon that subject. In many of the other States the boundaries are less precise.
        In some of them every cause is to be tried in a court of common law, and upon that
        foundation every action may be considered as an action at common law, to be determined by a
        jury, if the parties, or either of them, choose it. Hence the same irregularity and
        confusion would be introduced by a compliance with this proposition, that I have already
        noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by the Pennsylvania minority. In one State
        a cause would receive its determination from a jury, if the parties, or either of them,
        requested it; but in another State, a cause exactly similar to the other, must be decided
        without the intervention of a jury, because the State judicatories varied as to common-law
        jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>It is obvious, therefore, that the Massachusetts proposition, upon this subject cannot
        operate as a general regulation, until some uniform plan, with respect to the limits of
        common-law and equitable jurisdictions, shall be adopted by the different States. To devise
        a plan of that kind is a task arduous in itself, and which it would require much time and
        reflection to mature. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to suggest any
        general regulation that would be acceptable to all the States in the Union, or that would
        perfectly quadrate with the several State institutions.</p>
      <p>It may be asked, Why could not a reference have been made to the constitution of this
        State, taking that, which is allowed by me to be a good one, as a standard for the United
        States? I answer that it is not very probable the other States would entertain the same
        opinion of our institutions as we do ourselves. It is natural to suppose that they are
        hitherto more attached to their own, and that each would struggle for the preference. If the
        plan of taking one State as a model for the whole had been thought of in the convention, it
        is to be presumed that the adoption of it in that body would have been rendered difficult by
        the predilection of each representation in favor of its own government; and it must be
        uncertain which of the States would have been taken as the model. It has been shown that
        many of them would be improper ones. And I leave it to conjecture, whether, under all
        circumstances, it is most likely that New York, or some other State, would have been
        preferred. But admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in the convention,
        still there would have been great danger of jealousy and disgust in the other States, at the
        partiality which had been shown to the institutions of one. The enemies of the plan would
        have been furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local prejudices against it,
        which perhaps might have hazarded, in no inconsiderable degree, its final establishment.</p>
      <p>To avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which the trial by jury ought to
        embrace, it is sometimes suggested by men of enthusiastic tempers, that a provision might
        have been inserted for establishing it in all cases whatsoever. For this I believe, no
        precedent is to be found in any member of the Union; and the considerations which have been
        stated in discussing the proposition of the minority of Pennsylvania, must satisfy every
        sober mind that the establishment of the trial by jury in ALL cases would have been an
        unpardonable error in the plan.</p>
      <p>In short, the more it is considered the more arduous will appear the task of fashioning a
        provision in such a form as not to express too little to answer the purpose, or too much to
        be advisable; or which might not have opened other sources of opposition to the great and
        essential object of introducing a firm national government.</p>
      <p>I cannot but persuade myself, on the other hand, that the different lights in which the
        subject has been placed in the course of these observations, will go far towards removing in
        candid minds the apprehensions they may have entertained on the point. They have tended to
        show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in the trial by jury in
        criminal cases, which is provided for in the most ample manner in the plan of the
        convention; that even in far the greatest proportion of civil cases, and those in which the
        great body of the community is interested, that mode of trial will remain in its full force,
        as established in the State constitutions, untouched and unaffected by the plan of the
        convention; that it is in no case abolished3 by that plan; and that there are great if not
        insurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and proper provision for it in
        a Constitution for the United States.</p>
      <p>The best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a constitutional establishment
        of the trial by jury in civil cases, and will be the most ready to admit that the changes
        which are continually happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of
        determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which that mode of trial now
        prevails. For my part, I acknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this State it might
        be advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at present apply, and might as
        advantageously be abridged in others. It is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not
        to obtain in all cases. The examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits, as
        well in these States as in Great Britain, afford a strong presumption that its former extent
        has been found inconvenient, and give room to suppose that future experience may discover
        the propriety and utility of other exceptions. I suspect it to be impossible in the nature
        of the thing to fix the salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to
        stop, and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion of the
        legislature.</p>
      <p>This is now clearly understood to be the case in Great Britain, and it is equally so in the
        State of Connecticut; and yet it may be safely affirmed that more numerous encroachments
        have been made upon the trial by jury in this State since the Revolution, though provided
        for by a positive article of our constitution, than has happened in the same time either in
        Connecticut or Great Britain. It may be added that these encroachments have generally
        originated with the men who endeavor to persuade the people they are the warmest defenders
        of popular liberty, but who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them in
        a favorite career. The truth is that the general GENIUS of a government is all that can be
        substantially relied upon for permanent effects. Particular provisions, though not
        altogether useless, have far less virtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them;
        and the want of them will never be, with men of sound discernment, a decisive objection to
        any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good government.</p>
      <p>It certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to affirm that there is no
        security for liberty in a Constitution which expressly establishes the trial by jury in
        criminal cases, because it does not do it in civil also; while it is a notorious fact that
        Connecticut, which has been always regarded as the most popular State in the Union, can
        boast of no constitutional provision for either.</p>
      <p>PUBLIUS.</p>
      <p>1 It has been erroneously insinuated, with regard to the court of chancery, that this court
        generally tries disputed facts by a jury. The truth is, that references to a jury in that
        court rarely happen, and are in no case necessary but where the validity of a devise of land
        comes into question.</p>
      <p>2 It is true that the principles by which that relief is governed are now reduced to a
        regular system; but it is not the less true that they are in the main applicable to SPECIAL
        circumstances, which form exceptions to general rules.</p>
      <p>3 Vide No. 81, in which the supposition of its being abolished by the appellate
        jurisdiction in matters of fact being vested in the Supreme Court, is examined and
        refuted.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 84</title>
    <p>Certain General and Miscellaneous Objections to the Constitution Considered and Answered</p>
    <p>From McLEAN's Edition, New York.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>IN THE course of the foregoing review of the Constitution, I have taken notice of, and
        endeavored to answer most of the objections which have appeared against it. There, however,
        remain a few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head or were forgotten
        in their proper places. These shall now be discussed; but as the subject has been drawn into
        great length, I shall so far consult brevity as to comprise all my observations on these
        miscellaneous points in a single paper.</p>
      <p>The most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of the convention
        contains no bill of rights. Among other answers given to this, it has been upon different
        occasions remarked that the constitutions of several of the States are in a similar
        predicament. I add that New York is of the number. And yet the opposers of the new system,
        in this State, who profess an unlimited admiration for its constitution, are among the most
        intemperate partisans of a bill of rights. To justify their zeal in this matter, they allege
        two things: one is that, though the constitution of New York has no bill of rights prefixed
        to it, yet it contains, in the body of it, various provisions in favor of particular
        privileges and rights, which, in substance amount to the same thing; the other is, that the
        Constitution adopts, in their full extent, the common and statute law of Great Britain, by
        which many other rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured.</p>
      <p>To the first I answer, that the Constitution proposed by the convention contains, as well
        as the constitution of this State, a number of such provisions.</p>
      <p>Independent of those which relate to the structure of the government, we find the
        following: Article 1, section 3, clause 7 "Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend
        further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of
        honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but the party convicted shall,
        nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according
        to law." Section 9, of the same article, clause 2 "The privilege of the writ of habeas
        corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public
        safety may require it." Clause 3 "No bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be
        passed." Clause 7 "No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States; and no person
        holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the
        Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any
        king, prince, or foreign state." Article 3, section 2, clause 3 "The trial of all crimes,
        except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State
        where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State,
        the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed."
        Section 3, of the same article "Treason against the United States shall consist only in
        levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No
        person shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same
        overt act, or on confession in open court." And clause 3, of the same section "The Congress
        shall have power to declare the punishment of treason; but no attainder of treason shall
        work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted." It
        may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, of equal importance with any
        which are to be found in the constitution of this State. The establishment of the writ of
        habeas corpus, the prohibition of ex-post-facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, TO WHICH WE
        HAVE NO CORRESPONDING PROVISION IN OUR CONSTITUTION, are perhaps greater securities to
        liberty and republicanism than any it contains. The creation of crimes after the commission
        of the fact, or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when
        they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have
        been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. The observations
        of the judicious Blackstone,1 in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital: "To
        bereave a man of life, Usays he,e or by violence to confiscate his estate, without
        accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once
        convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by
        secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less
        public, a less striking, and therefore A MORE DANGEROUS ENGINE of arbitrary government." And
        as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on
        the habeas-corpus act, which in one place he calls "the BULWARK of the British
        Constitution."2</p>
      <p>Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility.
        This may truly be denominated the corner-stone of republican government; for so long as they
        are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than
        that of the people.</p>
      <p>To the second that is, to the pretended establishment of the common and state law by the
        Constitution, I answer, that they are expressly made subject "to such alterations and
        provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same." They are
        therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of course
        have no constitutional sanction. The only use of the declaration was to recognize the
        ancient law and to remove doubts which might have been occasioned by the Revolution. This
        consequently can be considered as no part of a declaration of rights, which under our
        constitutions must be intended as limitations of the power of the government itself.</p>
      <p>It has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are, in their origin,
        stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgements of prerogative in favor of
        privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA,
        obtained by the barons, sword in hand, from King John. Such were the subsequent
        confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes. Such was the PETITION OF RIGHT assented
        to by Charles I., in the beginning of his reign. Such, also, was the Declaration of Right
        presented by the Lords and Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown
        into the form of an act of parliament called the Bill of Rights. It is evident, therefore,
        that, according to their primitive signification, they have no application to constitutions
        professedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate
        representatives and servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing; and as they
        retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations. "WE, THE PEOPLE of the
        United States, to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ORDAIN
        and ESTABLISH this Constitution for the United States of America." Here is a better
        recognition of popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal
        figure in several of our State bills of rights, and which would sound much better in a
        treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government.</p>
      <p>But a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less applicable to a Constitution
        like that under consideration, which is merely intended to regulate the general political
        interests of the nation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species of
        personal and private concerns. If, therefore, the loud clamors against the plan of the
        convention, on this score, are well founded, no epithets of reprobation will be too strong
        for the constitution of this State. But the truth is, that both of them contain all which,
        in relation to their objects, is reasonably to be desired.</p>
      <p>I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the extent in which they
        are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be
        dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not granted; and, on this very
        account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare
        that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for instance, should it be
        said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which
        restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a
        regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a
        plausible pretense for claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason, that
        the Constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse
        of an authority which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty
        of the press afforded a clear implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations
        concerning it was intended to be vested in the national government. This may serve as a
        specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive
        powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.</p>
      <p>On the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as has been said, I cannot forbear
        adding a remark or two: in the first place, I observe, that there is not a syllable
        concerning it in the constitution of this State; in the next, I contend, that whatever has
        been said about it in that of any other State, amounts to nothing. What signifies a
        declaration, that "the liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved"? What is the
        liberty of the press? Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmost
        latitude for evasion? I hold it to be impracticable; and from this I infer, that its
        security, whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution respecting it, must
        altogether depend on public opinion, and on the general spirit of the people and of the
        government.3 And here, after all, as is intimated upon another occasion, must we seek for
        the only solid basis of all our rights.</p>
      <p>There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point. The truth is, after
        all the declamations we have heard, that the Constitution is itself, in every rational
        sense, and to every useful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The several bills of rights in Great
        Britain form its Constitution, and conversely the constitution of each State is its bill of
        rights. And the proposed Constitution, if adopted, will be the bill of rights of the Union.
        Is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political privileges of the
        citizens in the structure and administration of the government? This is done in the most
        ample and precise manner in the plan of the convention; comprehending various precautions
        for the public security, which are not to be found in any of the State constitutions. Is
        another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding,
        which are relative to personal and private concerns? This we have seen has also been
        attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan. Adverting therefore to the substantial
        meaning of a bill of rights, it is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work
        of the convention. It may be said that it does not go far enough, though it will not be easy
        to make this appear; but it can with no propriety be contended that there is no such thing.
        It certainly must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of declaring the
        rights of the citizens, if they are to be found in any part of the instrument which
        establishes the government. And hence it must be apparent, that much of what has been said
        on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions, entirely foreign from the
        substance of the thing.</p>
      <p>Another objection which has been made, and which, from the frequency of its repetition, it
        is to be presumed is relied on, is of this nature: "It is improper," say the objectors, "to
        confer such large powers, as are proposed, upon the national government, because the seat of
        that government must of necessity be too remote from many of the States to admit of a proper
        knowledge on the part of the constituent, of the conduct of the representative body." This
        argument, if it proves any thing, proves that there ought to be no general government
        whatever. For the powers which, it seems to be agreed on all hands, ought to be vested in
        the Union, cannot be safely intrusted to a body which is not under every requisite control.
        But there are satisfactory reasons to show that the objection is in reality not well
        founded. There is in most of the arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of
        the imagination. What are the sources of information by which the people in Montgomery
        County must regulate their judgment of the conduct of their representatives in the State
        legislature? Of personal observation they can have no benefit. This is confined to the
        citizens on the spot. They must therefore depend on the information of intelligent men, in
        whom they confide; and how must these men obtain their information? Evidently from the
        complexion of public measures, from the public prints, from correspondences with their
        representatives, and with other persons who reside at the place of their deliberations. This
        does not apply to Montgomery County only, but to all the counties at any considerable
        distance from the seat of government.</p>
      <p>It is equally evident that the same sources of information would be open to the people in
        relation to the conduct of their representatives in the general government, and the
        impediments to a prompt communication which distance may be supposed to create, will be
        overbalanced by the effects of the vigilance of the State governments. The executive and
        legislative bodies of each State will be so many sentinels over the persons employed in
        every department of the national administration; and as it will be in their power to adopt
        and pursue a regular and effectual system of intelligence, they can never be at a loss to
        know the behavior of those who represent their constituents in the national councils, and
        can readily communicate the same knowledge to the people. Their disposition to apprise the
        community of whatever may prejudice its interests from another quarter, may be relied upon,
        if it were only from the rivalship of power. And we may conclude with the fullest assurance
        that the people, through that channel, will be better informed of the conduct of their
        national representatives, than they can be by any means they now possess of that of their
        State representatives.</p>
      <p>It ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the country at and near the
        seat of government will, in all questions that affect the general liberty and prosperity,
        have the same interest with those who are at a distance, and that they will stand ready to
        sound the alarm when necessary, and to point out the actors in any pernicious project. The
        public papers will be expeditious messengers of intelligence to the most remote inhabitants
        of the Union.</p>
      <p>Among the many curious objections which have appeared against the proposed Constitution,
        the most extraordinary and the least colorable is derived from the want of some provision
        respecting the debts due TO the United States. This has been represented as a tacit
        relinquishment of those debts, and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters. The
        newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on this head; yet there is
        nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation, the offspring of
        extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty. In addition to the remarks I have made upon the
        subject in another place, I shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of
        common-sense, so it is also an established doctrine of political law, that "STATES NEITHER
        LOSE ANY OF THEIR RIGHTS, NOR ARE DISCHARGED FROM ANY OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS, BY A CHANGE IN
        THE FORM OF THEIR CIVIL GOVERNMENT."4 The last objection of any consequence, which I at
        present recollect, turns upon the article of expense. If it were even true, that the
        adoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerable increase of expense, it
        would be an objection that ought to have no weight against the plan.</p>
      <p>The great bulk of the citizens of America are with reason convinced, that Union is the
        basis of their political happiness. Men of sense of all parties now, with few exceptions,
        agree that it cannot be preserved under the present system, nor without radical alterations;
        that new and extensive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and that these
        require a different organization of the federal government a single body being an unsafe
        depositary of such ample authorities. In conceding all this, the question of expense must be
        given up; for it is impossible, with any degree of safety, to narrow the foundation upon
        which the system is to stand. The two branches of the legislature are, in the first
        instance, to consist of only sixty-five persons, which is the same number of which Congress,
        under the existing Confederation, may be composed. It is true that this number is intended
        to be increased; but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population and resources
        of the country. It is evident that a less number would, even in the first instance, have
        been unsafe, and that a continuance of the present number would, in a more advanced stage of
        population, be a very inadequate representation of the people.</p>
      <p>Whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring? One source indicated, is the
        multiplication of offices under the new government. Let us examine this a little.</p>
      <p>It is evident that the principal departments of the administration under the present
        government, are the same which will be required under the new. There are now a Secretary of
        War, a Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a Secretary for Domestic Affairs, a Board of Treasury,
        consisting of three persons, a Treasurer, assistants, clerks, etc. These officers are
        indispensable under any system, and will suffice under the new as well as the old. As to
        ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign countries, the proposed Constitution
        can make no other difference than to render their characters, where they reside, more
        respectable, and their services more useful. As to persons to be employed in the collection
        of the revenues, it is unquestionably true that these will form a very considerable addition
        to the number of federal officers; but it will not follow that this will occasion an
        increase of public expense. It will be in most cases nothing more than an exchange of State
        for national officers. In the collection of all duties, for instance, the persons employed
        will be wholly of the latter description. The States individually will stand in no need of
        any for this purpose. What difference can it make in point of expense to pay officers of the
        customs appointed by the State or by the United States? There is no good reason to suppose
        that either the number or the salaries of the latter will be greater than those of the
        former.</p>
      <p>Where then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense which are to swell the
        account to the enormous size that has been represented to us? The chief item which occurs to
        me respects the support of the judges of the United States. I do not add the President,
        because there is now a president of Congress, whose expenses may not be far, if any thing,
        short of those which will be incurred on account of the President of the United States. The
        support of the judges will clearly be an extra expense, but to what extent will depend on
        the particular plan which may be adopted in regard to this matter. But upon no reasonable
        plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence.</p>
      <p>Let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that may attend the
        establishment of the proposed government. The first thing which presents itself is that a
        great part of the business which now keeps Congress sitting through the year will be
        transacted by the President. Even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally
        devolve upon him, according to general principles concerted with the Senate, and subject to
        their final concurrence. Hence it is evident that a portion of the year will suffice for the
        session of both the Senate and the House of Representatives; we may suppose about a fourth
        for the latter and a third, or perhaps half, for the former. The extra business of treaties
        and appointments may give this extra occupation to the Senate. From this circumstance we may
        infer that, until the House of Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present
        number, there will be a considerable saving of expense from the difference between the
        constant session of the present and the temporary session of the future Congress.</p>
      <p>But there is another circumstance of great importance in the view of economy. The business
        of the United States has hitherto occupied the State legislatures, as well as Congress. The
        latter has made requisitions which the former have had to provide for. Hence it has happened
        that the sessions of the State legislatures have been protracted greatly beyond what was
        necessary for the execution of the mere local business of the States. More than half their
        time has been frequently employed in matters which related to the United States. Now the
        members who compose the legislatures of the several States amount to two thousand and
        upwards, which number has hitherto performed what under the new system will be done in the
        first instance by sixty-five persons, and probably at no future period by above a fourth or
        fifth of that number. The Congress under the proposed government will do all the business of
        the United States themselves, without the intervention of the State legislatures, who
        thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their particular States, and will not
        have to sit in any proportion as long as they have heretofore done. This difference in the
        time of the sessions of the State legislatures will be clear gain, and will alone form an
        article of saving, which may be regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of
        expense that may be occasioned by the adoption of the new system.</p>
      <p>The result from these observations is that the sources of additional expense from the
        establishment of the proposed Constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined; that
        they are counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving; and that while it is
        questionable on which side the scale will preponderate, it is certain that a government less
        expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the Union.</p>

      <p>2. Vide Blackstone's "Commentaries," vol. iv., p. 438.</p>
      <p>3. To show that there is a power in the Constitution by which the liberty of the press may
        be affected, recourse has been had to the power of taxation. It is said that duties may be
        laid upon the publications so high as to amount to a prohibition. I know not by what logic
        it could be maintained, that the declarations in the State constitutions, in favor of the
        freedom of the press, would be a constitutional impediment to the imposition of duties upon
        publications by the State legislatures. It cannot certainly be pretended that any degree of
        duties, however low, would be an abridgment of the liberty of the press. We know that
        newspapers are taxed in Great Britain, and yet it is notorious that the press nowhere enjoys
        greater liberty than in that country. And if duties of any kind may be laid without a
        violation of that liberty, it is evident that the extent must depend on legislative
        discretion, respecting the liberty of the press, will give it no greater security than it
        will have without them. The same invasions of it may be effected under the State
        constitutions which contain those declarations through the means of taxation, as under the
        proposed Constitution, which has nothing of the kind. It would be quite as significant to
        declare that government ought to be free, that taxes ought not to be excessive, etc., as
        that the liberty of the press ought not to be restrained.</p>

    <title>FEDERALIST No. 85</title>
    <p>Concluding Remarks</p>
    <p>From MCLEAN's Edition, New York.</p>
    <author>HAMILTON</author>
    <body>
      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>
      <p>ACCORDING to the formal division of the subject of these papers, announced in my first
        number, there would appear still to remain for discussion two points: "the analogy of the
        proposed government to your own State constitution," and "the additional security which its
        adoption will afford to republican government, to liberty, and to property." But these heads
        have been so fully anticipated and exhausted in the progress of the work, that it would now
        scarcely be possible to do any thing more than repeat, in a more dilated form, what has been
        heretofore said, which the advanced stage of the question, and the time already spent upon
        it, conspire to forbid.</p>
      <p>It is remarkable, that the resemblance of the plan of the convention to the act which
        organizes the government of this State holds, not less with regard to many of the supposed
        defects, than to the real excellences of the former. Among the pretended defects are the
        re-eligibility of the Executive, the want of a council, the omission of a formal bill of
        rights, the omission of a provision respecting the liberty of the press. These and several
        others which have been noted in the course of our inquiries are as much chargeable on the
        existing constitution of this State, as on the one proposed for the Union; and a man must
        have slender pretensions to consistency, who can rail at the latter for imperfections which
        he finds no difficulty in excusing in the former. Nor indeed can there be a better proof of
        the insincerity and affectation of some of the zealous adversaries of the plan of the
        convention among us, who profess to be the devoted admirers of the government under which
        they live, than the fury with which they have attacked that plan, for matters in regard to
        which our own constitution is equally or perhaps more vulnerable.</p>
      <p>The additional securities to republican government, to liberty and to property, to be
        derived from the adoption of the plan under consideration, consist chiefly in the restraints
        which the preservation of the Union will impose on local factions and insurrections, and on
        the ambition of powerful individuals in single States, who may acquire credit and influence
        enough, from leaders and favorites, to become the despots of the people; in the diminution
        of the opportunities to foreign intrigue, which the dissolution of the Confederacy would
        invite and facilitate; in the prevention of extensive military establishments, which could
        not fail to grow out of wars between the States in a disunited situation; in the express
        guaranty of a republican form of government to each; in the absolute and universal exclusion
        of titles of nobility; and in the precautions against the repetition of those practices on
        the part of the State governments which have undermined the foundations of property and
        credit, have planted mutual distrust in the breasts of all classes of citizens, and have
        occasioned an almost universal prostration of morals.</p>
      <p>Thus have I, fellow-citizens, executed the task I had assigned to myself; with what
        success, your conduct must determine. I trust at least you will admit that I have not failed
        in the assurance I gave you respecting the spirit with which my endeavors should be
        conducted. I have addressed myself purely to your judgments, and have studiously avoided
        those asperities which are too apt to disgrace political disputants of all parties, and
        which have been not a little provoked by the language and conduct of the opponents of the
        Constitution. The charge of a conspiracy against the liberties of the people, which has been
        indiscriminately brought against the advocates of the plan, has something in it too wanton
        and too malignant, not to excite the indignation of every man who feels in his own bosom a
        refutation of the calumny. The perpetual changes which have been rung upon the wealthy, the
        well-born, and the great, have been such as to inspire the disgust of all sensible men. And
        the unwarrantable concealments and misrepresentations which have been in various ways
        practiced to keep the truth from the public eye, have been of a nature to demand the
        reprobation of all honest men. It is not impossible that these circumstances may have
        occasionally betrayed me into intemperances of expression which I did not intend; it is
        certain that I have frequently felt a struggle between sensibility and moderation; and if
        the former has in some instances prevailed, it must be my excuse that it has been neither
        often nor much.</p>
      <p>Let us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed
        Constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and
        whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the
        public safety and prosperity. Every man is bound to answer these questions to himself,
        according to the best of his conscience and understanding, and to act agreeably to the
        genuine and sober dictates of his judgment. This is a duty from which nothing can give him a
        dispensation. 'T is one that he is called upon, nay, constrained by all the obligations that
        form the bands of society, to discharge sincerely and honestly. No partial motive, no
        particular interest, no pride of opinion, no temporary passion or prejudice, will justify to
        himself, to his country, or to his posterity, an improper election of the part he is to act.
        Let him beware of an obstinate adherence to party; let him reflect that the object upon
        which he is to decide is not a particular interest of the community, but the very existence
        of the nation; and let him remember that a majority of America has already given its
        sanction to the plan which he is to approve or reject.</p>
      <p>I shall not dissemble that I feel an entire confidence in the arguments which recommend the
        proposed system to your adoption, and that I am unable to discern any real force in those by
        which it has been opposed. I am persuaded that it is the best which our political situation,
        habits, and opinions will admit, and superior to any the revolution has produced.</p>
      <p>Concessions on the part of the friends of the plan, that it has not a claim to absolute
        perfection, have afforded matter of no small triumph to its enemies. "Why," say they,
        "should we adopt an imperfect thing? Why not amend it and make it perfect before it is
        irrevocably established?" This may be plausible enough, but it is only plausible. In the
        first place I remark, that the extent of these concessions has been greatly exaggerated.
        They have been stated as amounting to an admission that the plan is radically defective, and
        that without material alterations the rights and the interests of the community cannot be
        safely confided to it. This, as far as I have understood the meaning of those who make the
        concessions, is an entire perversion of their sense. No advocate of the measure can be
        found, who will not declare as his sentiment, that the system, though it may not be perfect
        in every part, is, upon the whole, a good one; is the best that the present views and
        circumstances of the country will permit; and is such an one as promises every species of
        security which a reasonable people can desire.</p>
      <p>I answer in the next place, that I should esteem it the extreme of imprudence to prolong
        the precarious state of our national affairs, and to expose the Union to the jeopardy of
        successive experiments, in the chimerical pursuit of a perfect plan. I never expect to see a
        perfect work from imperfect man. The result of the deliberations of all collective bodies
        must necessarily be a compound, as well of the errors and prejudices, as of the good sense
        and wisdom, of the individuals of whom they are composed. The compacts which are to embrace
        thirteen distinct States in a common bond of amity and union, must as necessarily be a
        compromise of as many dissimilar interests and inclinations. How can perfection spring from
        such materials?</p>
      <p>The reasons assigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately published in this city,1 are
        unanswerable to show the utter improbability of assembling a new convention, under
        circumstances in any degree so favorable to a happy issue, as those in which the late
        convention met, deliberated, and concluded. I will not repeat the arguments there used, as I
        presume the production itself has had an extensive circulation. It is certainly well worthy
        the perusal of every friend to his country. There is, however, one point of light in which
        the subject of amendments still remains to be considered, and in which it has not yet been
        exhibited to public view. I cannot resolve to conclude without first taking a survey of it
        in this aspect.</p>
      <p>It appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration, that it will be far more easy to
        obtain subsequent than previous amendments to the Constitution. The moment an alteration is
        made in the present plan, it becomes, to the purpose of adoption, a new one, and must
        undergo a new decision of each State. To its complete establishment throughout the Union, it
        will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen States. If, on the contrary, the
        Constitution proposed should once be ratified by all the States as it stands, alterations in
        it may at any time be effected by nine States. Here, then, the chances are as thirteen to
        nine2 in favor of subsequent amendment, rather than of the original adoption of an entire
        system.</p>
      <p>This is not all. Every Constitution for the United States must inevitably consist of a
        great variety of particulars, in which thirteen independent States are to be accommodated in
        their interests or opinions of interest. We may of course expect to see, in any body of men
        charged with its original formation, very different combinations of the parts upon different
        points. Many of those who form a majority on one question, may become the minority on a
        second, and an association dissimilar to either may constitute the majority on a third.
        Hence the necessity of moulding and arranging all the particulars which are to compose the
        whole, in such a manner as to satisfy all the parties to the compact; and hence, also, an
        immense multiplication of difficulties and casualties in obtaining the collective assent to
        a final act. The degree of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the number of
        particulars and the number of parties.</p>
      <p>But every amendment to the Constitution, if once established, would be a single
        proposition, and might be brought forward singly. There would then be no necessity for
        management or compromise, in relation to any other point no giving nor taking. The will of
        the requisite number would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue. And consequently,
        whenever nine, or rather ten States, were united in the desire of a particular amendment,
        that amendment must infallibly take place. There can, therefore, be no comparison between
        the facility of affecting an amendment, and that of establishing in the first instance a
        complete Constitution.</p>
      <p>In opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments, it has been urged that the
        persons delegated to the administration of the national government will always be
        disinclined to yield up any portion of the authority of which they were once possessed. For
        my own part I acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, upon mature
        consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the organization of the government,
        not to the mass of its powers; and on this account alone, I think there is no weight in the
        observation just stated. I also think there is little weight in it on another account. The
        intrinsic difficulty of governing thirteen States at any rate, independent of calculations
        upon an ordinary degree of public spirit and integrity, will, in my opinion constantly
        impose on the national rulers the necessity of a spirit of accommodation to the reasonable
        expectations of their constituents. But there is yet a further consideration, which proves
        beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the observation is futile. It is this that the
        national rulers, whenever nine States concur, will have no option upon the subject. By the
        fifth article of the plan, the Congress will be obliged "on the application of the
        legislatures of two thirds of the States, which at present amount to nine, to call a
        convention for proposing amendments, which shall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as
        part of the Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the States,
        or by conventions in three fourths thereof." The words of this article are peremptory. The
        Congress "shall call a convention." Nothing in this particular is left to the discretion of
        that body. And of consequence, all the declamation about the disinclination to a change
        vanishes in air. Nor however difficult it may be supposed to unite two thirds or three
        fourths of the State legislatures, in amendments which may affect local interests, can there
        be any room to apprehend any such difficulty in a union on points which are merely relative
        to the general liberty or security of the people. We may safely rely on the disposition of
        the State legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national
        authority.</p>
      <p>If the foregoing argument is a fallacy, certain it is that I am myself deceived by it, for
        it is, in my conception, one of those rare instances in which a political truth can be
        brought to the test of a mathematical demonstration. Those who see the matter in the same
        light with me, however zealous they may be for amendments, must agree in the propriety of a
        previous adoption, as the most direct road to their own object.</p>
      <p>The zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the establishment of the Constitution, must abate
        in every man who is ready to accede to the truth of the following observations of a writer
        equally solid and ingenious: "To balance a large state or society Usays hee, whether
        monarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of so great difficulty, that no human
        genius, however comprehensive, is able, by the mere dint of reason and reflection, to effect
        it. The judgments of many must unite in the work; experience must guide their labor; time
        must bring it to perfection, and the feeling of inconveniences must correct the mistakes
        which they INEVITABLY fall into in their first trials and experiments."3 These judicious
        reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the Union, and ought
        to put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of
        the States from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious demagogue, in
        the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain, but from time and experience. It may be
        in me a defect of political fortitude, but I acknowledge that I cannot entertain an equal
        tranquillity with those who affect to treat the dangers of a longer continuance in our
        present situation as imaginary. A nation, without a national government, is, in my view, an
        awful spectacle. The establishment of a Constitution, in time of profound peace, by the
        voluntary consent of a whole people, is a prodigy, to the completion of which I look forward
        with trembling anxiety. I can reconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now
        have, in so arduous an enterprise, upon seven out of the thirteen States, and after having
        passed over so considerable a part of the ground, to recommence the course. I dread the more
        the consequences of new attempts, because I know that powerful individuals, in this and in
        other States, are enemies to a general national government in every possible shape.</p>
