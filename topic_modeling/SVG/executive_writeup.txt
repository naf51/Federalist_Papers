is seen much more frequently in some papers than others, such as Federalist Paper 69, which shows a topic relevance of over 50%, which is extremely significant. The data implies that Hamilton really didn't mention the executive at all besides on the papers that concerned the executive branch. Although the executive is talked about more frequently and seems to be the most important issue among the public, it is not as prevalent during this time. Considering such a low topic relevance of populism in 69, the contrast with executive and having most of the statements be elitist, this makes sense. Hamilton supported a stronger executive branch with a present and authoritative leader. This significantly opposed the ideas of the people who were fed up with the British King and its dogma.
