make up this topic are:

government situation number country long interests large spirit support experience weight establishment america resources extensive political doubt safety individuals human

Each bar on the graph represents the the frequency in the given paper that words from this specific topic appear together. You will see that this topic, populism, is seen much
more frequently in some papers than others, such as Federalist Papers 11 and 12, which both show a topic relevance of almost 20%, which is pretty significant. Given that 11 and 12 dealt with the military and revenue, it is interesting that Hamilton's rhetoric and writing was reflecting populist / commonly held ideas. However, looking at 67, which deals with the executive, there is a low topic relevance. This makes sense because the working class did not want a single figure with large amounts of power, because it reflected too much of the British Crown. Looking at all the papers, there is a consistent reference to populist ideas, which implies that Hamilton did support some of the public's views on certain issues. He certainly supported theirs relating to military matters, since he was an officer in the Revolution and wanted a strong military / navy.
