Paper 84 is well-known as being controversial because Hamilton states that he does not believe that a Bill of Rights should be granted to citizens. This is certainly not a populist idea, but the rhetoric of 84 involves much of the legislative branch, since it would be responsible for formulating and passing the Bill of Rights.
