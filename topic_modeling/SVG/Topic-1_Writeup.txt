Each bar on the graph represents the the frequency in the given paper that words from this specific topic appear together. You will see that this topic, populism, is seen much
more frequently in some papers than others, such as Federalist Papers 11 and 12, which both show a topic relevance of almost 20%, which is pretty significant. Populism aligns with the views of the masses, who at this time in history, opposed tyrannical Britain. Some of these views were strong liberties and freedoms but allowed financial freedom and a government that was non-imperialist, or isolationist. Under Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party, a strong, centralized government would have to be present with the ability to tax. It is important to note that nothing regarding finances, taxation, or the government's power is shown with these key words. These words are symbolic of an individualism that encompasses a safe, free, and supportive society.
