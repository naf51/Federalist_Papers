Each bar on the graph represents the the frequency in the given paper that words from this specific topic appear together. You will see that this topic, populism, is seen much
more frequently in some papers than others, such as Federalist Papers 11 and 12, which both show a topic relevance of almost 20%, which is pretty significant. Populism aligns with the views of the masses, who at this time in history, opposed tyrannical Britain. Some of these views were strong liberties and freedoms but allowed financial freedom and a government that was non-imperialist, or isolationist. Given that 11 and 12 dealt with the military and revenue, it is interesting that Hamilton's rhetoric and writing was reflecting populist / commonly held ideas. However, looking at 67, which deals with the executive, there is a low topic relevance. This makes sense because the working class did not want a single figure with large amounts of power, because it reflected too much of the British Crown.
